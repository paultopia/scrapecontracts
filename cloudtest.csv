These platforms enable online sharing and collaboration among users who have registered to use them. Any content you post on John Hancock social media pages, such as pictures, videos, information, opinions, “Likes”, or any Personal Information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those platforms.
Some of our Websites may include social media buttons or icons (“plug-ins”) that enable users to easily share information on a social media platform.   These plug-ins may log certain information such as your IP address, browser type and language, and what webpages you view and when. If you are logged into those social media platforms while using our Websites, they may also link such collected information with your profile on that platform. We do not control these third-party tracking technologies.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies on social media platforms where you have an account to better understand how these third parties collect and treat such information. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of the social media platforms we use.
How We Protect Your Personal Information
To help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and use, we use a combination of security measures and maintain physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to keep it safe.  For example, we employ encryption techniques such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and authentication technologies intended to safeguard the transmission of your Personal Information over the Internet.  Some of our Websites utilize a timeout feature which will automatically log you out of your account after a period of idle time.
You should be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  There are steps you can take to help protect yourself, such as:
Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software on your computing device.
Update your software when updates or patches become available to help address vulnerabilities that phishing scams and viruses may seek to exploit.
If you maintain an account that you access through our Websites or Apps, you are responsible for protecting and maintaining the confidentiality of your user id and password and restricting access to your computing device.
If you have a John Hancock account that is accessible online and become aware of any suspicious activity, it is your responsibility to contact us immediately.
Internet email is not necessarily secure. For that reason, do not use unsecured email to communicate sensitive or Personal Information to us that you may consider to be confidential.
Always use an encrypted webpage or application to transmit personal or financial information.  An “https://” and a padlock icon displayed in the address bar of your web browser will confirm you are on encrypted sections of our Websites.
We recommend never disclosing your financial or personal details on any social media site.
John Hancock Apps should only be downloaded from the official Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
Be Aware of Phishing Emails
To help protect yourself, do not trust any unsolicited email communication that requests your Personal Information.   Criminals can make fraudulent emails look like they come from legitimate sources, including John Hancock, or include links or instructions directing you to a website designed and operated by criminals to trick you into revealing such information.  To help protect you, John Hancock will never send an unsolicited email, text, chat message, or social media message asking you to provide or update your personal or account information.  If you receive a message that appears to be from John Hancock and it asks you to respond by providing personal or financial information, do not reply or click on the link.  Instead, contact John Hancock directly to confirm the legitimacy of the message you received.

Collecting Account Information from Other Financial Institutions
In order to provide certain advice or services to you, you may direct us to retrieve and aggregate information from accounts you have with other financial institutions.  It may include current balances, transaction histories, and holdings from brokerage accounts, investment accounts, bank accounts, credit card accounts, and similar accounts you designate.    By providing the name of the other financial institution, your username, password and other necessary information, you grant John Hancock and its authorized service providers the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and securely transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution(s) you designate.
John Hancock cannot guarantee and is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of the information we retrieve, or for technical difficulties and service interruptions which may result in a failure or delay in obtaining data from the accounts you have with other financial institutions.
“Do Not Track” Signals
Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual’s Internet activity that is used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes.  Certain browsers offer users the ability to activate a “Do Not Track” signal.  Like many other websites and online services, we do not currently process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals from your browser. Both we and our service providers may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities over time and across third-party websites.
Children
Our products and services are not marketed to or intended for use by minors. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information online from anyone under the age of 13 and request that any individuals under 13 years of age not provide Personal Information through our Websites or Apps.   If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us.
International Visitors
John Hancock’s Websites and Apps are hosted in the United States and Canada. If you are an international visitor, you should note that by providing your Personal Information, you are permitting:
·       the transfer of your Personal Information to the United States or Canada which may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside; and
·       the use of your Personal Information in accordance with this privacy policy.
Links to other Websites
For your convenience and information, some of our Websites may contain links to other websites or online services, including social media sites, or present content or features from other sites or other third parties that are not affiliated with us. The inclusion of any link by us does not imply our endorsement, and this Statement does not apply to other web sites or online services. We do not monitor nor maintain the privacy practices of these websites, and do not have any authority over them. If you follow links to sites not affiliated or controlled by John Hancock, we encourage you to review their privacy and security policies and other terms and conditions, as they may be different from ours. John Hancock does not guarantee and is not responsible for the privacy or security of these sites, including their accuracy, completeness, or reliability.
Your Rights and Choices
We offer you certain choices about how we communicate with you and what information we collect from you online. Some of our Websites or Apps provide features that allow you to access and update Personal Information you have provided, or register your communications preferences.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can change your browser’s settings to disable or refuse cookies or to inform you when they are set. You also have the ability to delete cookies that you have accepted. If you delete or disable cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Websites.

You can opt-out of analytics activity by setting your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent and block analytics cookies if desired. Review your browser's Help Menu for instructions.
