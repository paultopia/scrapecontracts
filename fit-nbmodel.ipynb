    "1. What Information Do We Collect\n",
    "\n",
    "We collect two types of online information: non-personal and personal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Personal Information\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visit our site, we collect the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. In addition, we gather information such as what browser and which version of it you're using, the type of operating system you have, and which site you came from or advertisement you viewed or clicked on. This device information helps us provide an online experience that matches your device and to manage our online advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also supplement the information we collect with information we receive from other companies. For example, we may use marketing segments developed by us or other companies to customize certain services to your local area and provide relevant Citi offers tailored to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal Information\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the information described in the previous section, we may also gather personal information that you provide to us such as your name, address, phone number, and email address. Collecting this personal information enables us to offer you online experiences that help you with your financial needs. For example, we collect personal information when you are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Banking online\n",
    "Applying for a new program or account\n",
    "If you've enrolled in Citi services, such as online bill payment, we collect personal information about your transactions, and how you interact with third parties such as those you pay like a utility company or phone company. Collecting this information enables us to provide you these services. You can refer to the terms and conditions for your account or service to learn how your information is collected and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have received personal information from you, or have information that is publicly available from other sources, we may use it in combination with the information that Citi collects online. This information may be used to better tailor or personalize our service and marketing communications with you, both online and offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a Citi customer, the personal information you provide online is held by the Citi business that maintains your account or is processing your application for a new product or service. You can access and/or change information in connection with your account or application by logging on to your account online or telephoning customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see our Privacy Notices, which we provide to all our individual customers, for a comprehensive explanation of how we collect, use and share personal information and what you can do to limit the use and sharing of your information as our customer.

    "Citi uses the information we collect about and from you to provide services, to manage our business and to offer an enhanced, personalized online experience on our site and third-party websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information we collect allows us to:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. How Do Our Online Services Use Cookies and other Tracking Technologies?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookies and Flash Objects\n",
    "When you browse our site or view one of our emails, or advertisements, Citi and companies we work with, use Flash objects, cookies, web beacons and/or pixel tags to collect device information and store your online preferences, but they do not capture any information that can be used to personally identify you. The information they gather helps us improve your online experience and may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your response to one of our emails or advertisements\n",
    "Time and duration of your visit to our site\n",
    "Pages you viewed while on our site\n",
    "Device Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "We may use similar technologies, particularly in mobile advertising, that use device information to help deliver our advertisements and measure advertising campaign effectiveness. We and companies we work with may collect your device information when you visit one of our sites or see our ads. Compiling and comparing these attributes can create a unique ID for individual devices and can be \"matched\" to the same attributes appearing on other sites or mobile applications. Some companies we work with are also able to associate related devices into households based on common characteristics, such as IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted Advertising\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies we work with place and track our advertisements on third-party websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. We place advertisements by developing and using our own marketing segments that may combine online and offline information about our current and prospective customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our Online Privacy Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can You Control Your Information That's Collected and Used Online?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the information we use about you helps us provide you with products, services and experiences that benefit you. You have the ability to control how your non-personal information is collected and used online.\n",
    "\n",
    "E-Mail\n",
    "\n",
    "When you provide your email address, we will use it to send you general notices or important news about your account, request your feedback or opinions and provide updates on special deals and offers that might interest you.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe you should be able to choose what kinds of information you receive via email. If you do not want to receive marketing materials by email, just indicate your preference on the contact information for your account or the 'opt-out' link provided in our marketing emails. Please keep in mind that we will continue to notify you by email regarding your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookies and Flash Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control whether to accept cookies or not. If you decide to not accept cookies, some features and services on our site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Citi account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or\n",
    "Set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies\n",
    "Deleting cookies does not delete Flash objects. You can learn more about Flash objects - including how to control and disable them - through the Adobe interface. If you choose to delete Flash objects from our sites, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the sites or benefit from the information and services offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted Advertising\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that online behavioral advertising helps to provide you with more relevant advertising based upon on the websites you visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information. To do so please visit the NAI Opt-Out Page. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising govern certain online advertising and data collection practices. The principles facilitate transparency about online advertising practices and support consumer choice in managing behavioral advertising. We subscribe to these Principles. For more information about the Principles and the Ad Choices icon visit http://www.youradchoices.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Because mobile devices may vary in how they operate and may not use cookies, the choice management options listed above may not work for all mobile devices and mobile apps. Mobile ad management providers make available tools for managing your choices regarding behavioral advertising on mobile devices and mobile apps. Depending upon the advertising company, if you opt out on one device they may also opt you out on any screen considered part of the same household.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do Not Track\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, there is no standard for how Do Not Track consumer browser settings should work on commercial websites, the industry has self-regulatory initiatives designed to provide consumers a choice in the types of ads they may see online and to conveniently opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all of the companies participating in these programs. Due to a lack of such standards, our websites do not respond to Do Not Track consumer browser settings. For more information see the \"About Ads\" or NAI links provided above. Many of Citi's advertising vendors and companies participate in these programs. Using the choice mechanisms these programs make available may help you see advertising that is relevant to you or help you avoid seeing interest based advertising generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "From time to time, we may change this Online Privacy Statement. The effective date of this statement, as indicated below, shows the last time this statement was revised or materially changed. Checking the effective date below allows you to determine whether there have been changes since the last time you reviewed the statement.\n",

Please read this carefully and retain it for future reference. If you sign the signature card or open or continue to use the account, you agree to these rules. You will receive a separate schedule of rates, qualifying balances, and fees if they are not included in this document. If you have any questions, please call us.\n",

    "This agreement is subject to applicable federal laws, the laws of the state of Iowa and other applicable rules such as the operating letters of the Federal Reserve Banks and payment processing system rules (except to the extent that this agreement can and does vary such rules or laws). The body of state and federal law that governs our relationship with you, however, is too large and complex to be reproduced here. The purpose of this document is to:\n",

    "If any provision of this document is found to be unenforceable according to its terms, all remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. We may permit some variations from our standard agreement, but we must agree to any variation in writing either on the signature card for your account or in some other document.\n",
    "\n",
    "As used in this document the words “we,” “our,” and “us” mean the financial institution and the words “you” and “your” mean the account holder(s) and anyone else with the authority to deposit, withdraw, or exercise control over the funds in the account. However, this agreement does not intend, and the terms “you” and “your” should not be interpreted, to expand an individual’s responsibility for an organization’s liability. If this account is owned by a corporation, partnership or other organization, individual liability is determined by the laws generally applicable to that type of organization. The headings in this document are for convenience or reference only and will not govern the interpretation of the provisions. Unless it would be inconsistent to do so, words and phrases used in this document should be construed so the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIABILITY - You agree, for yourself (and the person or entity you represent if you sign as a representative of another) to the terms of this account and the schedule of charges. You authorize us to deduct these charges, without notice to you, directly from the account balance as accrued. You will pay any additional reasonable charges for services you request which are not covered by this agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of you also agrees to be jointly and severally (individually) liable for any account shortage resulting from charges or overdrafts, whether caused by you or another with access to this account. This liability is due immediately, and can be deducted directly from the account balance whenever sufficient funds are available. You have no right to defer payment of this liability, and you are liable regardless of whether you signed the item or benefited from the charge or overdraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be liable for our costs as well as for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent permitted by law, whether incurred as a result of collection or in any other dispute involving your account. This includes, but is not limited to, disputes between you and another joint owner; you and an authorized signer or similar party; or a third party claiming an interest in your account. This also includes any action that you or a third party takes regarding the account that causes us, in good faith, to seek the advice of an attorney, whether or not we become involved in the dispute. All costs and attorneys’ fees can be deducted from your account when they are incurred, without notice to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "DEPOSITS - We will give only provisional credit until collection is final for any items, other than cash, we accept for deposit (including items drawn “on us”). Before settlement of any item becomes final, we act only as your agent, regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement on the item  and even though we provide you provisional credit for the item. We may reverse any provisional credit for items that are lost, stolen, or returned. Actual  credit  for deposits of, or payable in, foreign currency will be at the exchange rate in effect on final collection in U.S. dollars. We are not responsible for transactions by mail or outside depository until we actually record them. We will treat and record all transactions received after our “daily cutoff time” on a business day we are open, or received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated on the next business day that we are open. At our option, we may take an item for collection rather than for deposit. If we accept a third-party check for deposit, we may require any third-party indorsers to verify or guarantee their indorsements, or indorse in our presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "WITHDRAWALS -\n",
    "Generally - Unless clearly indicated otherwise on the account records, any of you, acting alone, who signs to open the account or has authority to make withdrawals may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the account balance at any time. Each of you (until we receive written notice to the contrary) authorizes each other person who signs or has authority to make withdrawals to indorse any item payable to you or your order for deposit to this account or any other transaction with us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Postdated checks - A postdated check is one which bears a date later than the date on which the check is written. We may properly pay and charge your account for a postdated check even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless we have received written notice of the postdating in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act. Because we process checks mechanically, your notice will not be effective and we will not be liable for failing to honor your notice unless it precisely identifies the number, date, amount and payee of the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checks and withdrawal rules - If you do not purchase your check blanks from us, you must be certain that we approve the check blanks you purchase. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which you attempt on forms not approved by us or by any method we do not specifically permit. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which is greater in number than the frequency permitted, or which is for an amount greater or less than any withdrawal limitations. We will use the date the transaction is completed by us (as opposed to the date you initiate it) to apply the frequency limitations. In addition, we may place limitations on the account until your identity is verified. Any withdrawal requests initiated and authorized by you, including, but not limited to, those made at an automated teller machine (ATM) and point-of-sale (POS) terminal, may be allowed to overdraw your available account balance and may be subject to applicable overdraft fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we honor a nonconforming request, we are not required to do so later. If you violate the stated transaction limitations (if any), in our discretion we  may close your account or reclassify it as a transaction account. If we reclassify your account, your account will be subject to the fees and earnings rules of the new account classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are presented with an item drawn against your account that would be a “substitute check,” as defined by law, but for an error or defect in the item introduced in the substitute check creation process, you agree that we may pay such item.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the funds availability policy disclosure for information about when you can withdraw funds you deposit. For those accounts to which our funds availability policy disclosure does not apply, you can ask us when you make a deposit when those funds will be available for withdrawal. We may determine the amount of available funds in your account for the purpose of deciding whether to return an item for insufficient funds at any time between the time we receive the item and when we return the item or send a notice in lieu of return. We need only make one determination, but if we choose to make a subsequent determination,  the account balance at the subsequent time will determine whether there  are insufficient available funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A temporary debit authorization hold affects your account balance - On debit card purchases, merchants may request a temporary hold on your account for a specified sum of money, which may be more than the actual amount of your purchase. When this happens, our processing system cannot determine that the amount of the hold exceeds the actual amount of your purchase. This temporary hold, and the amount charged to your account, will eventually be adjusted to the actual amount of your purchase, but it may be up to three days before the adjustment is made. Until the adjustment is made, the amount of funds in your account available for other transactions will be reduced by the amount of the temporary hold. If another transaction is presented for payment in an amount greater than the funds left after the deduction of the temporary hold amount, that transaction will be a nonsufficient funds (NSF) transaction if we do not pay it or an overdraft transaction if we do pay it. You will be charged an NSF or overdraft fee according to our NSF or overdraft fee policy. You will be charged the fee even if you would have had sufficient funds in your account if the amount of the hold had been equal to the amount of your purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how this can occur – assume for this example the following: (1) you have opted-in to our overdraft services for the payment of overdrafts on ATM and everyday debit card transactions, (2) we pay the overdraft, and (3) our overdraft fee is $27 per overdraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have $120 in your account. You swipe your card at the card reader on a gasoline pump. Since it is unclear what the final bill will be, the gas station’s processing system immediately requests a hold on your account in a specified amount, for example, $80. Our processing system authorizes a temporary hold on your account in the amount of $80, and the gas station’s processing system authorizes you to begin pumping gas. You fill your tank and the amount of gasoline you purchased is only $50. Our processing system shows that you have $40 in your account available for other transactions ($120 - $80 = $40) even though you would have $70 in your account available for other transactions if the amount of the temporary hold was equal to the amount of your purchase ($120 - $50 = $70). Later, another transaction you have authorized is presented  for payment from your account in the amount of $60 (this could be a check you have written, another debit card transaction, an ACH debit or any other  kind of payment request). This other transaction is presented before the amount of the temporary hold is adjusted to the amount of your purchase  (remember, it may take up to three days for the adjustment to be made). Because the amount of this other transaction is greater than the amount our  processing system shows is available in your account, our payment of this  transaction will result in an overdraft transaction. Because the transaction overdraws your account by $20, your account will be assessed the overdraft fee of $27 according to our overdraft fee policy. You will be charged this $27 fee according to our policy even though you would have had enough money in your account to cover the $60 transaction if your account had only been debited the amount of your purchase rather than the amount of the temporary hold or if  the temporary hold had already been adjusted to the actual amount of your purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overdrafts - \n",
    "You understand that we may, at our discretion, honor withdrawal requests that overdraw your account. However, the fact that we may honor withdrawal requests that overdraw the account balance does not obligate us to do so later. So you can NOT rely on us to pay overdrafts on your account regardless of how frequently or under what circumstances we have paid overdrafts on your account in the past. We can change our practice of paying overdrafts on your account without notice to you. You can ask us if we have other account services that might be available to you where we commit to  paying overdrafts under certain circumstances, such as an overdraft protection line-of- credit or a plan to sweep funds from another account you have with  us. You agree that we may charge fees for overdrafts. For consumer accounts, we will not charge fees for overdrafts caused by ATM withdrawals or one-time debit card transactions if you have not opted-in to that service. We  may use subsequent deposits, including direct deposits of social security or other government benefits, to cover such overdrafts and overdraft fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple signatures, electronic check conversion, and similar transactions - An electronic check conversion transaction is a transaction where a check or similar item is converted into an electronic fund transfer as defined in the Electronic Fund Transfers regulation. In these types of transactions the check or similar item is either removed from circulation (truncated) or given back to you. As a result, we have no opportunity to review the check to examine the signatures on the item. You agree that, as to these or any items as to which we have no opportunity to examine the signatures, you waive any requirement of multiple signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice of withdrawal - We reserve the right to require not less than 7 days’ notice in writing before each withdrawal from an interest-bearing account other than a time deposit, or from any other savings account as defined by Regulation D. (The law requires us to reserve this right, but it is not our general policy to use it.) Withdrawals from a time account prior to maturity or prior to any notice period may be restricted and may be subject to penalty. See your notice of penalty for early withdrawal.\n",
    "\n",
    "OWNERSHIP OF ACCOUNT AND BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION - These rules apply to this account depending on the form of ownership and beneficiary designation, if any, specified on the account records. We make no representations as to the appropriateness or effect of the ownership and beneficiary designations, except as they determine to whom we pay the account funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual Account - is an account in the name of one person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joint Account - With Survivorship (And Not As Tenants In Common) - is an account in the name of two or more persons. Each of you intend that when you die the balance in the account (subject to any previous pledge to which we have agreed) will belong to the survivor(s). If two or more of you survive, you will own the balance in the account as joint tenants with survivorship and not as tenants in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joint Account - No Survivorship (As Tenants In Common) - is owned by two or more persons, but none of you intend (merely by opening this account) to create any right of survivorship in any other person. We encourage you to agree and tell us in writing of the percentage of the deposit contributed by each of you. This information will not, however, affect the “number of signatures” necessary for withdrawal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revocable Trust or Pay-On-Death Account - If two or more of you create this type of account, you own the account jointly with survivorship.  Beneficiaries cannot withdraw unless: (1) all persons creating the account  die, and (2) the beneficiary is then living. If two or more beneficiaries are named and survive the death of all persons creating the account, beneficiaries will own this account in equal shares, without right of survivorship. The person(s) creating either of these account types may: (1) change beneficiaries, (2) change account types, and (3) withdraw all or part of the account funds at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUSINESS, ORGANIZATION AND ASSOCIATION ACCOUNTS - Earnings in the form of interest, dividends, or credits will be paid only on collected funds, unless otherwise provided by law or our policy. You represent that you have the authority to open and conduct business on this account on behalf of the entity. We may require the governing body of the entity opening the account to give us a separate authorization telling us who is authorized to act on its behalf. We will honor the authorization until we actually receive written notice of a change from the governing body of the entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "STOP PAYMENTS - Unless otherwise provided, the rules in this section cover stopping payment of items such as checks and drafts. Rules for stopping payment of other types of transfers of funds, such as consumer electronic fund transfers, may be established by law or our policy. If we have not disclosed these rules to you elsewhere, you may ask us about those rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may accept an order to stop payment on any item from any one of you. You must make any stop-payment order in the manner required by law and we must receive it in time to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on it before our stop- payment cutoff time. Because stop-payment orders are handled by computers, to be effective, your stop-payment order must precisely identify the number, date, and amount of the item, and the payee. You may stop payment on any item drawn on your account whether you sign the item or not. Generally, your stop- payment order is effective for sixty months. Your order will lapse after that time if you do not renew the order before the end of the sixty-month period. If the original stop-payment order was verbal we may also require you to put your request in writing. If we require you to put your request in writing, your stop- payment order will lapse after 14 calendar days if you do not confirm your order in writing within that time period. You will be notified if we require you to put your request in writing. We are not obligated to notify you when a stop- payment order expires. A release of the stop-payment request may be made only by a person who has authority to make withdrawals from the account. [AG1] \n",
    "\n",
    "If you stop payment on an item and we incur any damages or expenses because of the stop payment, you agree to indemnify us for those damages or expenses, including attorneys’ fees. You assign to us all rights against the payee or any other holder of the item. You agree to cooperate with us in any legal actions that we may take against such persons. You should be aware that anyone holding the item may be entitled to enforce payment against you despite the stop-payment order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our stop-payment cutoff time is one hour after the opening of the next banking day after the banking day on which we receive the item. Additional limitations on our obligation to stop payment are provided by law (e.g., we paid the item in cash or we certified the item).\n",
    "\n",
    "TELEPHONE TRANSFERS - A telephone transfer of funds from this account to another account with us, if otherwise arranged for or permitted, may be made by the same persons and under the same conditions generally applicable to withdrawals made in writing. Unless a different limitation is disclosed in writing, we restrict the number of transfers from a savings account to another account or to third parties, to a maximum of six per month (less the number of “preauthorized transfers” during the month). Other account transfer restrictions may be described elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION - We may change any term of this agreement. Rules governing changes in interest rates are provided separately in the Truth-in-Savings disclosure or in another document. For other changes, we will give you reasonable notice in writing or by any other method permitted by law. We may also close this account at any time upon reasonable notice to you and tender of the account balance personally or by mail. Items presented for payment after the account is closed may be dishonored. When you close your account, you are responsible for leaving enough money in the account to cover any outstanding items to be paid from the account. Reasonable notice depends on the circumstances, and in some cases such as when we cannot verify your identity or we suspect fraud, it might be reasonable for us to give you notice after the change or account closure becomes effective. For instance, if we suspect fraudulent activity with respect to your account, we might immediately freeze or close your account and then give you notice. You agree to keep us informed of your current address at all times. Notice from us to any one of you is notice to all of you. If we have notified you of a change in any term of your account and you continue to have your account after the effective date of the change, you have agreed to the new term(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "STATEMENTS - Your duty to report unauthorized signatures, alterations and forgeries - You must examine your statement of account with “reasonable promptness.” If you discover (or reasonably should have discovered) any unauthorized signatures or alterations, you must promptly notify us of the relevant facts. As between you and us, if you fail to do either of these duties, you will have to either share the loss with us, or bear the loss entirely yourself (depending on whether we used ordinary care and, if not, whether we substantially contributed to the loss). The loss could be not only with respect to items on the statement but other items with unauthorized signatures or alterations by the same wrongdoer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You agree that the time you have to examine your statement and report to us will depend on the circumstances, but will not, in any circumstance, exceed a total of 30 days from when the statement is first sent or made available to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You further agree that if you fail to report any unauthorized signatures, alterations or forgeries in your account within 60 days of when we first send or make the statement available, you cannot assert a claim against us on any items in that statement, and as between you and us the loss will be entirely yours. This 60-day limitation is without regard to whether we used ordinary care. The limitation in this paragraph is in addition to that contained in the first paragraph of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your duty to report other errors - In addition to your duty to review your statements for unauthorized signatures, alterations and forgeries, you agree to examine your statement with reasonable promptness for any other error - such as an encoding error. You agree that the time you have to examine your statement and report to us will depend on the circumstances. However, such time period shall not exceed 60 days. Failure to examine your statement and report any such errors to us within 60 days of when we first send or make the statement available precludes you from asserting a claim against us for any such errors on items identified in that statement and as between you and us the loss will be entirely yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors relating to electronic fund transfers or substitute checks (For Consumer Accounts Only) - For information on errors relating to electronic fund transfers (e.g., computer, debit card or ATM transactions) refer to your Electronic Fund Transfers disclosure and the sections on consumer liability and error resolution. For information on errors relating to a substitute check you received, refer to your disclosure entitled Substitute Checks and Your Rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACCOUNT TRANSFER - This account may not be transferred or assigned without our prior written consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "DIRECT DEPOSITS - If we are required for any reason to reimburse the federal government for all or any portion of a benefit payment that was directly deposited into your account, you authorize us to deduct the amount of our liability to the federal government from the account or from any other account you have with us, without prior notice and at any time, except as prohibited by law. We may also use any other legal remedy to recover the amount of our liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "TEMPORARY ACCOUNT AGREEMENT - If this option is selected, this is a temporary account agreement. Each person who signs to open the account or has authority to make withdrawals (except as indicated to the contrary) may transact business on this account. However, we may at some time in the future restrict or prohibit further use of this account if you fail to comply with the requirements we have imposed within a reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "SETOFF - We may (without prior notice and when permitted by law) set off the funds in this account against any due and payable debt you owe us now or in the future, by any of you having the right of withdrawal, to the extent of such persons’ or legal entity’s right to withdraw. If the debt arises from a note, “any due and payable debt” includes the total amount of which we are entitled to demand payment under the terms of the note at the time we set off, including any balance the due date for which we properly accelerate under the note.\n",
    "\n",
    "This right of setoff does not apply to this account if prohibited by law. For example, the right of setoff does not apply to this account if: (a) it is an Individual Retirement Account or similar tax-deferred account, or (b) the debt is created by a consumer credit transaction under a credit card plan (but this does not affect our rights under any consensual security interest), or (c) the debtor’s right of withdrawal only arises in a representative capacity. We will not be liable for the dishonor of any check when the dishonor occurs because we set off a debt against this account. You agree to hold us harmless from any claim arising as a result of our exercise of our right of setoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cash a check at our institution and the check is returned unpaid, we will deduct the amount of the check from an account you own at our institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUTHORIZED SIGNER (Individual Accounts only) - A single individual is the owner. The authorized signer is merely designated to conduct transactions on the owner’s behalf. The owner does not give up any rights to act on the account, and the authorized signer may not in any manner affect the rights of the owner or beneficiaries, if any, other than by withdrawing funds from the account. The owner is responsible for any transactions of the authorized signer. We undertake no obligation to monitor transactions to determine that they are on the owner’s behalf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The owner may terminate the authorization at any time, and the authorization is automatically terminated by the death of the owner. However, we may continue to honor the transactions of the authorized signer until: (a) we have received written notice or have actual knowledge of the termination of authority, and (b) we have a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice or knowledge. We may refuse to accept the designation of an authorized signer.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTRICTIVE LEGENDS - The automated processing of the large volume  of checks we receive prevents us from inspecting or looking for special instructions or “restrictive legends” on every check. Examples of restrictive legends placed on checks are “must be presented within 90 days” or “not  valid for more than $1,000.00.” For this reason, we are not required to honor any restrictive legend placed on checks you write unless we have agreed in writing to the restriction. We are not responsible for any losses, claims, damages, or expenses that result from your placement of these or other special instructions on your checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PAYMENT ORDER OF ITEMS - The law permits us to pay items (such as checks or drafts) drawn on your account in any order. To assist you in handling your account with us, we are providing you with the following information regarding how we process the items that you write. When processing items drawn on your account, our policy is to pay them in check number order. Lower item numbers are paid first. The order in which items are paid is important if there is not enough money in your account to pay all of the items that are presented. There is no policy that is favorable in every instance. If the smallest items are paid first, you may have fewer NSF or overdraft fees, but the largest, and perhaps more important items (such as rent or mortgage payments) might not be paid. If an item is presented without sufficient funds in your account to pay it, we may, at our discretion, pay the item (creating an overdraft) or return the item (NSF). The amounts of the overdraft and NSF fees are disclosed elsewhere. By paying items in numerical sequence, we think our policy attains a reasonable balance between minimizing additional cost to you and paying your more important items. We encourage you to make careful records and practice good account management. This will help you to avoid writing checks or drafts without sufficient funds and incurring the resulting fees.\n",

    "FACSIMILE SIGNATURES - Unless you make advance arrangements with us, we have no obligation to honor facsimile signatures on your checks or other orders. If we do agree to honor items containing facsimile signatures, you authorize us, at any time, to charge you for all checks, drafts, or other orders, for the payment of money, that are drawn on us. You give us this authority regardless of by whom or by what means the facsimile signature(s) may have been affixed so long as they resemble the facsimile signature specimen filed with us, and contain the required number of signatures for this purpose. You  must notify us at once if you suspect that your facsimile signature is being or has been misused.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHECK PROCESSING - We process items mechanically by relying solely on the information encoded in magnetic ink along the bottom of the items. This means that we do not individually examine all of your items to determine if the item is properly completed, signed and indorsed or to determine if it contains any information other than what is encoded in magnetic ink. You agree that we have not failed to exercise ordinary care solely because we use our automated system to process items and do not inspect all items processed in such a manner. Using an automated process helps us keep costs down for you and all account holders.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHECK CASHING - We may charge a fee for anyone that does not have an account with us who is cashing a check, draft or other instrument written on your account. We may also require reasonable identification to cash such a  check, draft or other instrument. We can decide what identification is reasonable under the circumstances and such identification may be documentary or physical and may include collecting a thumbprint or fingerprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "INDORSEMENTS - We may accept for deposit any item payable to you or your order, even if they are not indorsed by you. We may give cash back to any one of you. We may supply any missing indorsement(s) for any item we accept for deposit or collection, and you warrant that all indorsements are genuine.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that your check or share draft is processed without delay, you must indorse it (sign it on the back) in a specific area. Your entire indorsement (whether a signature or a stamp) along with any other indorsement information (e.g. additional indorsements, ID information, driver’s license number, etc.) must fall within 11/2” of the “trailing edge” of a check. Indorsements must be made in blue or black ink, so that they are readable by automated check processing equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you look at the front of a check, the “trailing edge” is the left edge. When you flip the check over, be sure to keep all indorsement information within 11/2” of that edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you confine the indorsement information to this area since the remaining blank space will be used by others in the processing of the check to place additional needed indorsements and information. You agree that you will indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless for any loss, liability, damage or expense that occurs because your indorsement, another indorsement or information you have printed on the back of the check obscures our indorsement.\n",
    "\n",
    "These indorsement guidelines apply to both personal and business checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "DEATH OR INCOMPETENCE - You agree to notify us promptly if any person with a right to withdraw funds from your account(s) dies or becomes legally incompetent. We may continue to honor your checks, items, and instructions until: (a) we know of your death or incompetence, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree that we may pay or certify checks drawn on or before the date of death or legal incompetence for up to ten (10) days after your death or legal incompetence unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming an interest in the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIDUCIARY ACCOUNTS - Accounts may be opened by a person acting in a fiduciary capacity. A fiduciary is someone who is appointed to act on behalf of and for the benefit of another. This account may be opened and maintained by a person or persons named as a trustee under a written trust agreement, or as executors, administrators, or conservators under court orders. You understand that by merely opening such an account, we are not acting in the capacity of a trustee in connection with the trust nor do we undertake any obligation to monitor or enforce the terms of the trust or letters.\n",

    "LEGAL ACTIONS AFFECTING YOUR ACCOUNT - If we are served with a subpoena, restraining order, writ of attachment or execution, levy, garnishment, search warrant, or similar order relating to your account (termed “legal action” in this section), we will comply with that legal action. Or, in our discretion, we may freeze the assets in the account and not allow any payments out of the account until a final court determination regarding the legal action. We may do these things even if the legal action involves less than all of you. In these cases, we will not have any liability to you if there are insufficient funds to pay your items because we have withdrawn funds from your account or in any way restricted access to your funds in accordance with the legal action. Any fees or expenses we incur in responding to any legal action (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and our internal expenses) may be charged against your account. The list of fees applicable to your account(s) provided elsewhere may specify additional fees that we may charge for certain legal actions.\n",

    "SECURITY - It is your responsibility to protect the account numbers and electronic  access  devices  (e.g.,  an  ATM  card)  we  provide  you  for  your account(s). Do not discuss, compare, or share information about your account number(s) with anyone unless you are willing to give them full use of your money. An account number can be used by thieves to encode your number on a false demand draft which looks like and functions like an authorized check. If you furnish your access device and grant actual authority to make transfers to another person (a family member or coworker, for example) who then exceeds that authority, you are liable for the transfers unless we have been notified that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your account number can also be used to electronically remove money from your account. If you provide your account number in response to a telephone solicitation for the purpose of making a transfer (to purchase a service or merchandise, for example), payment can be made from your account even though you did not contact us directly and order the payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also take precaution in safeguarding your blank checks. Notify us at once if you believe your checks have been lost or stolen. As between you and us, if you are negligent in safeguarding your checks, you must bear the loss entirely yourself or share the loss with us (we may have to share some of the loss if we failed to use ordinary care and if we substantially contributed to the loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "You agree that if we offer you services appropriate for your account to help identify and limit fraud or other unauthorized transactions against your account, such as positive pay or commercially reasonable security procedures, and you reject those services, you will be responsible for any fraudulent or unauthorized transactions which could have been prevented by the services we offered, unless we acted in bad faith or to the extent our negligence contributed to the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "TELEPHONIC INSTRUCTIONS - Unless required by law or we have agreed otherwise in writing, we are not required to act upon instructions you give us via facsimile transmission or leave by voice mail or on a telephone answering machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLAIM OF LOSS - If you claim a credit or refund because of a forgery, alteration, or any other unauthorized withdrawal, you agree to cooperate with us in the investigation of the loss, including giving us an affidavit containing whatever reasonable information we require concerning your account, the transaction, and the circumstances surrounding the loss. You will notify law enforcement authorities of any criminal act related to the claim of lost, missing, or stolen checks or unauthorized withdrawals. We will have a reasonable period of time to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding any claim of loss. Unless we have acted in bad faith, we will not be liable for special or consequential damages, including loss of profits or opportunity, or for attorneys’ fees incurred by you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You agree that you will not waive any rights you have to recover your loss against anyone who is obligated to repay, insure, or otherwise reimburse you for your loss. You will pursue your rights or, at our option, assign them to us so that we may pursue them. Our liability will be reduced by the amount you recover or are entitled to recover from these other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "EARLY WITHDRAWAL PENALTIES (and involuntary withdrawals) - We may impose early withdrawal penalties on a withdrawal from a time account even if you don’t initiate the withdrawal. For instance, the early withdrawal penalty may be imposed if the withdrawal is caused by our setoff against funds in the account or as a result of an attachment or other legal process. We may close your account and impose the early withdrawal penalty on the entire account balance in the event of a partial early withdrawal. See your notice of penalty for early withdrawals for additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADDRESS OR NAME CHANGES - You are responsible for notifying us of any change in your address or your name. Unless we agree otherwise, change  of address or name must be made in writing by at least one of the account holders. Informing us of your address or name change on a check reorder  form is not sufficient. We will attempt to communicate with you only by use  of the most recent address you have provided to us. If provided elsewhere, we may impose a service fee if we attempt to locate you.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESOLVING ACCOUNT DISPUTES - We may place an administrative hold on the funds in your account (refuse payment or withdrawal of the funds) if it becomes subject to a claim adverse to (1) your own interest; (2) others claiming an interest as survivors or beneficiaries of your account; or (3) a claim arising by operation of law. The hold may be placed for such period of time as we believe reasonably necessary to allow a legal proceeding to determine the merits of the claim or until we receive evidence satisfactory to us that the dispute has been resolved. We will not be liable for any items that are dishonored as a consequence of placing a hold on funds in your account for these reasons.\n",

    "ACH AND WIRE TRANSFERS - This agreement is subject to Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code - Fund Transfers as adopted in the state in which you have your account with us. If you originate a fund transfer and you identify by name and number a beneficiary financial institution, an intermediary  financial institution or a beneficiary, we and every receiving or beneficiary  financial institution may rely on the identifying number to make payment. We may rely on the number even if it identifies a financial institution, person or account other than the one named. You agree to be bound by automated clearing house association rules. These rules provide, among other things, that payments made to you, or originated by you, are provisional until final settlement is made through a Federal Reserve Bank or payment is otherwise made as provided in Article 4A-403(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code. If we do not receive such payment, we are entitled to a refund from you in the amount credited to your account and the party originating such payment will not be considered to have paid the amount so credited. If we receive a payment order to credit an account you have with us by wire or ACH, we are not required to give you any notice of the payment order or credit.\n",

    "TRUNCATION, SUBSTITUTE CHECKS, AND OTHER CHECK IMAGES - If you truncate an original check and create a substitute check, or other paper or electronic image of the original check, you warrant that no one will be asked to make payment on the original check, a substitute check or any other electronic or paper image, if the payment obligation relating to the original check has already been paid. You also warrant that any substitute check you create conforms to the legal requirements and generally accepted specifications for substitute checks. You agree to retain the original check in conformance with our internal policy for retaining original checks. You agree to indemnify us for any loss we may incur as a result of any truncated check transaction you initiate. We can refuse to accept substitute checks that have not previously been warranted by a bank or other financial institution in conformance with the Check 21 Act.

    "Electronic Fund Transfers Initiated By Third Parties. You may authorize a third party to initiate electronic fund transfers between your account and the third party’s account. These transfers to make or receive payment may be one-time occurrences or may recur as directed by you. These transfers may use the Automated Clearing House (ACH) or other payments network. Your authorization to the third party to make these transfers can occur in a number of ways. For example, your authorization to convert a check to an electronic fund transfer or to electronically pay a returned check charge can occur when a merchant provides you with notice and you go forward with the transaction (typically, at the point of purchase, a merchant will post a sign and print the notice on a receipt). In all cases, these third party transfers will require you to provide the third party with your account number and bank information. This information can be found on your check as well as on a deposit or withdrawal slip. Thus, you should only provide your bank and account information (whether over the phone, the Internet, or via some other method) to trusted third parties whom you have authorized to initiate these electronic fund transfers.

The Bank may periodically transfer funds between these two sub accounts. On a sixth transfer during a calendar month, any funds in the savings sub account will be transferred back to the checking sub account. If your account is a plan on which interest is paid, your interest calculation will remain the same. Otherwise, the savings sub account will be non interest bearing. The savings sub account will be governed by the rules governing our other savings accounts. This process will not affect your available balance, the interest you may earn, FDIC insurance protection, or your monthly statement.\n",

    "We may require not less than 7 days’ notice in writing before each withdrawal from an interest-bearing account other than a time deposit, or from any other savings account as defined by Regulation D.

    "Remotely Created Checks: Like any standard check or draft, a remotely created check (sometimes called a telecheck, preauthorized draft, or demand draft) is a check or draft that can be used to withdraw money from an account. Unlike a typical check or draft, however, a remotely created check is not issued by the paying bank and does not contain the signature of the account owner (or a signature purported to be the signature of the account owner). In place of a signature, the check usually has a statement that the owner authorized the check or has the owner's name typed or printed on the signature line. For example, if a person provides an account number in response to a telephone solicitation, the telephone solicitor can use the account number to issue a remotely created check to withdraw money from that account.\n",
    "\n",
    "You warrant and agree to the following for every remotely created check we receive from you for deposit or collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "you have received express and verifiable authorization to create the check in the amount and to the payee that appears on the check;\n",
    "you will maintain proof of the authorization for at least 2 years from the date of the authorization, and supply us the proof if we ask; and\n",
    "if a check is returned you owe us the amount of the check, regardless of when the check is returned. We may take funds from your account to pay the amount you owe us, and if there are insufficient funds in your account, you still owe us the remaining balance.\n",
