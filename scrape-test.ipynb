It’s a smart strategy, but if you have trouble leaving your home or primary position to get to a second job, you’ll find yourself frustrated and stressed out.Perhaps you’re raising kids and you’re committed to not using daycare. Maybe you’re a little older and can’t commit to a full-time job. Or you might be injured or disabled, making it difficult for you to leave your home each day.\\xa0Whatever your reason is, if you’re stuck at home most of the day, you’ve probably thought about the income you could be making by taking a work-from-home job or running your own business.Good news: There are plenty of legitimate ways to earn extra money sitting right where you are right now.\\xa0Some of them involve starting your own small business, while others mean working for someone else using your home as an office.These endeavors aren’t without traps and challenges, though, so before we take a look at some legitimate ways to make money from your home, let’s review a few things that you should avoid.\\xa0Unfortunately, if you want to earn an honest living from home, you’re also a common\\xa0target of scammers, especially in\\xa0these economically tough times. But if you keep these simple rules in mind, you won’t become a victim of one of the many\\xa0work from home scams.Legitimate Ways to Make Money from HomeLet’s look at a few real ways you can work from your home and make the extra cash that you and your family need.1. Downsize and Declutter: Sell Your Unwanted StuffBefore you really roll up your sleeves and monetize your personal or professional skills, why not\\xa0right-size your life?\\xa0Selling your unwanted stuff is a great way to downsize and declutter your life while earning some income on the side. If you’re transitioning to full-time work-at-home status, that income could provide a critical boost to your plans for a proper\\xa0home office, or allow you to maintain your lifestyle during lean times without resorting to voluntary simplicity.When it comes to at-home income, selling your unwanted stuff is the definition of “low-hanging fruit.” Even if you’re resolutely intentional in your purchasing habits, you surely have possessions that you can do without: old kids’ clothing and toys, disused sporting goods, out-of-fashion wardrobe accessories, electronics, entertainment, valuable but non-sentimental keepsakes such as watches and jewelry, broken-in furniture, dusty tools and outdoor equipment, and perhaps even big-ticket items like a motorcycle or second car.The real question is: how and where do you sell all that stuff?Sell Your Old Stuff Online With Decluttr Start online.One of the best places to sell unwanted personal possessions is\\xa0Decluttr, a website that buys used items directly from consumers. Unlike trade-in marketplaces such as Gazelle and auction websites such as eBay, Decluttr doesn’t act as a middleman between buyers and sellers. Rather, it’s best understood as a bulk buyer: an enterprise with deep pockets and an unsatiable appetite for used consumer products.Decluttr specializes in entertainment (digital and analog) and consumer technology: books, DVDs, CDs, Blu-rays, games, tablets, laptops, smartphones. That makes it an excellent choice for folks looking to\\xa0reuse and recycle\\xa0technology products and reduce electronic waste, which is particularly damaging to the environment and human health.Decluttr is easy to use. Grab an unwanted item, check that Decluttr buys it\\xa0(for instance: CDs are great, old clothing is not), and enter its barcode into Decluttr’s “valuation engine” or use your Decluttr smartphone app (iOS and Android) to scan your item directly. You’ll receive an instant price quote that you can accept or decline with no obligation. If you accept, just pack your items into a box large enough to fit them, slap a free Decluttr shipping label on it, and bring it to any authorized UPS location (including drop boxes, if your box contains fewer than 25 items). Decluttr issues your payment the day after your item arrives by PayPal, direct deposit, or paper check. There’s no practical limit to the number of items you can sell: each order is technically limited to 500 items, but you can create as many orders as you like in any given timeframe.Decluttr has some crucial advantages over other online selling platforms:Next Day Payment: When you sell on Decluttr, you receive payment within 24 hours after the sale completes and the item arrives at the new owner’s address. That’s substantially faster than many online consignment platforms, which tend to have more flexible payment terms. And it’s much more predictable than auction sites or venues for third party sellers (including Amazon), which typically allow buyers and sellers to work out their own payment arrangements.No Sales Commissions or Auction Fees: Since it acts as the sole buyer of products sold through its website, Decluttr doesn’t have to charge commissions on completed sales, nor auction listing fees. When you sell on an auction site, you need to accept both types of fees – and, in many cases, a steep haircut on your take-home earnings.Free Shipping: You don’t have to pay to ship your sold items to Decluttr. Shipping costs are factored into the price Decluttr is willing to pay for the items it buys. All you need to do is box up your item and drop it at a UPS location.Bulk Selling: For all practical purposes, you can sell as many items as you like on Decluttr. If you reach the 500-item-per-order limit, just start a new order. This is a big advantage\\xa0for folks staring down huge boxes of old DVDs, CDs, and textbooks. And it’s a distinct competitive edge on retail trade-in platforms, which may require users to enter their items one at a time.User-friendly App: Decluttr is a mobile-ready platform made for selling on the go. The mobile app is a great help when you’re hunched over miscellaneous boxes in your dank basement or sweltering attic. You can use the app to scan in your items directly and utilize Decluttr’s “valuation engine” to quickly and easily see exactly how much you can earn. Many popular online selling platforms, including eBay and Amazon, are designed first and foremost with desktop and laptop users in mind.Other Digital OptionsDecluttr is a great way to quickly offload large volumes of old stuff at a fair price, but it’s not the only digital selling option in town. Depending on the amount of effort you’re willing to give and your preferred sales model, these alternatives are worth considering:eBay: eBay is one of the most popular websites in the world, period. That means it’s a great way to attract lots of eyeballs to your unwanted items, fast. Initially designed as an auction site for DIY sellers, it’s now primarily a venue for fixed-price (though often heavily discounted) sales by professional merchants. Still, as long as you include high-quality photographs and thorough descriptions in your product listings, you can likely break through the noise.\\xa0eBay’s fee schedule is complex, but as a general rule, expect to lose 10% of your final selling price to the site’s commission.Amazon: Many people don’t realize that Amazon is a haven for third party sellers, including regular Joes and Janes cleaning out their attics and garages. If you plan to sell more than 40 items per month on Amazon, consider registering as a professional seller. You’ll need to pay a $39.99 monthly subscription fee, a referral fee that usually ranges from 6% to 20%, \\xa0and a $1.35-per-item closing fee for media items. You won’t pay the $0.99-per-item selling fee, however. Alternatively, register as an individual seller. The fee schedule is the same as for professionals, except you do have to pay the selling fee and don’t have to pay the subscription fee.Craigslist: Craigslist is definitely the scrappiest of the major online resale options. The advantage of Craigslist is its enticing profit potential, thanks to the total lack of listing and selling fees for most items. The disadvantages are many, but include potential safety risks and higher chances of nonpayment. If you do choose Craigslist, keep your wits about you and use the buddy system.Trade-in (Resale) Marketplaces: There are plenty of other places to sell your stuff online, especially if they’re electronic. Popular and reputable online resale marketplaces include USell, Gazelle, and MaxBack. Major retailers such as Best Buy have extensive trade-in programs as well, as do national carriers such as Verizon and AT&T.Hold a Yard or Garage SalePrefer to do things the old fashioned way? Sell whatever you can’t or don’t want to offload online at a\\xa0garage sale\\xa0instead.Follow these tips for a successful garage sale:Set a Popular Time and Date: Most garage sales happen on weekends, and for good reason – that’s when the most people are out and about, seeking great deals on great finds. To maximize your exposure, consider a three-day event over a long weekend. If you live in a cold climate, wait until the weather warms.Make Sure You’re Legal: Before setting up your sale, make sure it’s legal to do so in your community. There’s a good chance you’ll need a permit, but getting one is usually a formality and rarely requires a substantial financial investment.Advertise Locally: Advertise your garage sale in appropriate local venues: your city’s Craigslist page, community social media sites such as Nextdoor, your local newspaper (online and in print, if applicable), and any relevant local publications (such as neighborhood magazines or your Patch outlet).Put Up Wayfinding Signs: Don’t assume that every prospective buyer will find his or her way to your place via Google Maps or Waze. Put up wayfinding signs in visible locations around your neighborhood, ideally on main roads leading to your street and multiple street corners in your home’s immediate vicinity.Research Pricing (And Set Fair Starting Prices): Before setting prices for each item, research your local Craigslist website and (if possible) nearby yard sales to get a sense of how to price them. Remember that many buyers will try to haggle – so set prices a bit higher than your bottom dollar, but not so high that you’ll scare off first bids. 10% to 15% is a good rule of thumb. Consider bunching low-value items, such as old CDs, into lots of five or 10, or offer x-for-$y deals.Accommodate Multiple Forms of Payment: Many deal-seekers carry cash, but you want to accommodate every potential buyer. So, in the days leading up to the event, consider purchasing a point-of-sale system that can accept credit cards. Square is a popular and relatively cost-effective option: it doesn’t cost anything upfront and bundles credit card processing fees into its own per-transaction fees, resulting in a net expense of 2.75% for most transactions (net of $97.25 for every $100 charged). This is a small price to pay to capture the ever-growing cashless consumer demographic.\\xa0On the day before the sale, visit the bank and grab $100 in small bills and coin rolls to ensure you’ll have enough change for buyers who do prefer cash.2. Freelance Writing: Sell Your WordsI may as well start with something I know well.\\xa0When I started out as a freelance writer 20 years ago, things were very different.\\xa0I wrote mostly for magazines, and I had to rely on snail mail to send out drafts and queries. I’d wait weeks for a response from my editors.\\xa0Not many people had the patience for it, and few stuck around long enough to ever start earning a real income from it.But the Internet has changed everything.\\xa0Today, you can decide to become a freelance writer and, if you’re fortunate, get an assignment that very same day.\\xa0Obviously, the better your skills and training are, the better your projects and freelance writing rates will be.Today’s freelance writers can choose from a variety of markets.\\xa0You can write for magazines, either online or in print.\\xa0You can blog by setting up your own site, or by writing for someone else’s.\\xa0The market for new articles on the Internet is vast, and there’s plenty of work to go around.Additionally, book publishers are always looking for the next big book.\\xa0People need sales letters, white papers, website copy, and e-books.\\xa0In other words, there’s an ocean of work to do, and if you’re an ambitious writer, you can dive in and profit.If you want to work from home as a freelance writer, consider this checklist before you get started:Samples. You’ll need some samples before you can really begin marketing yourself.\\xa0Figure out which market you want to approach first, and then find or create some related samples.\\xa0For instance, if you want to try your hand at blogging, study some successful blogs, and then write a few posts of your own to use as samples.\\xa0Do this for any and every market you’d want to write for.Tools. You don’t need much to work as a home-based freelance writer, but there are some tools that you must have.\\xa0The most important will be your computer. Get the fastest Internet access that you can afford.\\xa0It doesn’t matter what kind of computer you get. Just make sure you’re comfortable enough to spend a lot of time with it.\\xa0Most clients will request that you submit your work as a Microsoft Word document, so make sure that whatever programs you use are compatible.\\xa0In addition, because you’ll be spending so much time at the computer, make sure that you have a good work area with proper lighting.\\xa0Some clients will want to be able to reach you by phone or Skype, so have both set up and accessible.\\xa0You’ll need an invoicing program, such as Freshbooks, and a good bookkeeping system to keep track of sales, orders, and accounts receivables.Job Boards. When you’re first starting out, you’ll have to go looking for work, and the best place to do that is on one of the online job boards.\\xa0Places like Guru, Elance, Freelancer, and oDesk\\xa0are today’s writers’ best friends.\\xa0They allow individuals and businesses to post projects, and freelancers to bid on them.\\xa0Take a look around the sites, sign up for the free access in the beginning, and then begin to place bids on the projects that interest you. It will take some trial and error to find your groove, but once you do, the jobs will start to roll in.Persistence and Commitment. You’ll need to have a good amount of persistence while pursuing freelance writing gigs.\\xa0This business is subjective, and while one person may love your writing, another may not.\\xa0Do your best to always produce good, solid copy and hold on to your commitment to do the best you can for your clients.\\xa0Just by committing to do those two things, you’ll be miles ahead of your competition.3. Classes: Sell Your KnowledgeAnother great way to earn money from your home office is to sell your skills or knowledge by teaching classes.\\xa0For instance, if you’re an exercise guru, you might start an exercise class in a large spacious area in your home.\\xa0People are willing to pay to learn about many fields of knowledge, from cooking and gardening to soap or candle making. Playing a musical instrument, child birthing, dancing, dog training, yoga, and even foreign languages are all great topics for expert classes.The key is to make the class sound unique and irresistible.\\xa0Don’t just teach a cooking class; come up with specialty cooking classes.\\xa0You might teach a class on how to make artesian breads, or cinnamon rolls that rival Cinnabon.\\xa0The possibilities are endless, and if you consistently offer educational and fun classes, you’ll have people signing up over and over again.But being successful at hosting your own classes requires some serious planning and attention to detail.\\xa0Here is an outline of the things you’ll have to consider:Your Idea. It’s not enough to say that you’re going to offer an exercise classes.\\xa0The people considering your classes will want to know exactly what they are going to get for their money, and it will be up to you to explain it concisely and effectively. Understand that you’re basically giving a sales pitch to potential attendees. You’ll have to really narrow down your topic.Your Schedule. Decide in advance how often you want to teach your class, and what times will work for you. If you’re teaching a foreign language, you will want to offer structured classes that meet at the same time every week.\\xa0But if you intend to offer cooking classes, where one lesson won’t run into another, you can be a little more flexible.Remember that you’re making a commitment that will last weeks or months, and you won’t want to end up canceling classes. Pick a schedule that you can keep.Furthermore, carefully consider your likely attendees, and what schedule would be attractive to them. For example, if you’re planning on teaching a tutoring class, you obviously couldn’t schedule it during school hours.\\xa0Likewise, a class aimed at mothers of young children will either have to include babysitting services or be scheduled at night, when they’re more likely to have help with the kids. Find the delicate balance of times that fit your prospective students’ schedules as well as your own.Your Price. When establishing a price for your classes, start by calling around and finding out what other choices your clients have.\\xa0If you plan to offer cooking classes, call some commercial establishments and other in-home teachers. Compare your own talent and experience to what they’re offering, and set a price accordingly. You should always come in a little lower than classes offered by commercial establishments as that will be one of your selling points: expert information for less money.Your Deals. In addition to establishing a per-class price, also offer packages to entice people to sign up for more than one class.\\xa0For example, if you intend to host classes on making soap, offer the classes individually, as well as in a group.\\xa0Someone could take a class learning how to use fresh flowers in homemade soap, or they could buy a bundle that teaches them how to use those, fresh herbs, and plastic toys for kid’s soap.\\xa0However you decide to price your classes, remember that the buyer will want to feel like they’re getting a lot for their money.\\xa0If you can provide that in a fun atmosphere, they’ll likely be back time and time again – and they’ll bring friends.Your Ads. The key to success will be in your ability to get the word out about your classes.\\xa0Word of mouth will play an important role in your marketing efforts because taking classes is something that friends like to do together.\\xa0Don’t just rely on friends and family, though. Post fliers in supermarkets, churches, and school bulletin boards.\\xa0You’ll definitely want to have an online presence so people who are searching your area for such classes will be able to find you.\\xa0You can establish one by creating a website, and then using digital media to spread your message.\\xa0And don’t forget your neighborhood as a source of business.\\xa0Take some time to visit your neighbors, even if you just visit one block a day, and tell them about your new business.4. Bed and Breakfast: Sell Space in Your HomeIf you have a spare bedroom and bathroom, and a high tolerance for other people being in your home, you may be able to make money from home by hosting people in your home. Overnight travelers are always looking for a comfortable bed and breakfast, especially since frequent travelers are often weary of hotels and motels.Your home is certainly more attractive than the mainstream sterile environments and run of the mill decor.\\xa0Savvy homeowners have been taking advantage of their spare space, and they’re making money by offering travelers a one of a kind experience in a warm, friendly environment.The best part is that people who use bed and breakfasts are more likely to pay more for the experience.\\xa0The challenge is that there’s a lot of competition in this field, so if you think earning money this way is right for you, you’ll have to set up your home in a way that makes for a memorable experience for guests.\\xa0Here’s a checklist to get you started:Location. The most successful bed and breakfasts are those that are convenient to airports, historic parts of town, or other tourist attractions. That’s because there are two types of guests who tend to frequent B&B’s: business travelers who are tired of sterile hotel rooms, and families looking for a unique experience.\\xa0That’s not to say that you can’t develop a successful B&B if your home isn’t located in the perfect spot, but you might have to work harder to make it a success if it isn’t.Comfort. Perhaps the biggest thing that you’ll need to do in order to create a successful B&B is to make sure that your guests are as comfortable as they can be.\\xa0Remember, they’re paying more for the experience of being comfortable away from home.\\xa0As a trial, spend a night in the room in your house that you intend to rent and view things from a guest’s point of view. Is the temperature comfortable?\\xa0Is the bath in the room, or at least a comfortable distance away while still being private?\\xa0Is the bed soft and inviting? The pillows? Is the bedroom interior design, including colors, soothing?\\xa0Can you hear household noises, or do you feel that you’re in a world of your own?\\xa0All of these are important questions to ask yourself, but the answers will determine whether or not your guests recommend your place, or come back for another stay. Think about all the minor inconveniences and discomforts that you’ve just gotten used to over the years, and remember that a paying guest might not tolerate those problems for a night. You may need to spend a little money to fix these issues.Food. The second word in “Bed and Breakfast” is just as important as the first.\\xa0Some B&Bs have tried to serve their guests muffins, juice, and coffee in the mornings, but the most successful hosts understand that the breakfast they serve will make a lasting impression on their guests.\\xa0You can get creative and serve the type of breakfast traditional for the area that you’re in.\\xa0For instance, if your home is located in the South, then eggs, grits, and biscuits may go over well, while Southwest guests may appreciate a traditional Tex-Mex meal.\\xa0Whatever you decide, make it memorable and make sure that your guests feel welcome and appreciated. Make it memorable, and they’ll spread the word for you.Service. Another key aspect of successful B&Bs is the level of service that the hosts provide.\\xa0You’re not just offering room and board, but an experience.\\xa0If they need help planning a day seeing the sites, offer to sit down with them and help them plan their itinerary.\\xa0If a businessperson needs copies for a presentation, offer to go and make them.\\xa0Remember, your job as host will be to make your guests’ stays as comfortable and pleasurable as possible.\\xa0If you succeed, they’ll remember you the next time they travel through your town.Advertising. You won’t have any quests until you get the word around about your room.\\xa0Start locally by putting a sign in your front yard and spreading the word through friends and family.\\xa0Next, build a small website and make sure that you attract the search engine spiders by using the keywords people would likely search for when looking for a place to stay in your area.\\xa0In addition, there are sites that specialize in promoting specific areas and their attractions, such as BedandBreakfast.com\\xa0and Airbnb\\xa0– your Bed and Breakfast should be listed there.5. Farmers’ Market: Sell Your Produce and Gourmet FoodsEvery Saturday I visit the local farmers’ market, and every time I’m amazed at how wonderful their fruits and vegetables look compared to the choices in the grocery store.While I’m a gardener too, I’ve never quite been able to grow such fantastic looking produce.\\xa0If you’re blessed with a greener thumb than mine and you’re growing mass quantities of fruits, vegetables, or herbs, you just may be able to use those skills to earn some extra income.Farmers’ markets are rapidly becoming the go-to places for people who want to eat fresh, wholesome foods. Local and organic both sounds great to buyers, and you’re not just limited to selling fruits and vegetables.\\xa0Just yesterday I bought fresh homemade goat cheese and a roasted tomato pesto that almost brought me to tears.You’d do most of your work in a home garden, but you’ll have to spend your weekends away from home.\\xa0If you love the idea of selling your home-grown produce, but can’t swing being out of the house on weekends, consider selling to friends, family, and neighbors instead.\\xa0Almost everyone prefers the taste of a fresh picked tomato to a store bought one.While this is a great way to earn extra money doing what you love, you’ll need to keep a few things in mind before you get started:Selection. Lots of people will be selling produce, so if you want to be a success, you’ll have to make yours stand out.\\xa0You might try selling some rare vegetables or hard-to-find herbs, or you might decide to include a special recipe with every variety.License. As long as you’re only selling fresh produce, you don’t need a special license. But if you plan to sell gourmet foods, you’ll have to call your local health department and find out the regulations in your area.Rules. All markets have different rules that every vendor must follow.\\xa0You’ll have to file an application with the market for permission to sell your product.\\xa0Contact the market manager and ask how you can get started.Display. Just as in any retail operation, the way you display your wares will greatly impact your sales.\\xa0Produce should be placed underneath a cover to protect it from the sun, but be sure to allow at least seven feet of head room.\\xa0Display your prices prominently, and clearly identify the things that make your product special. Personalize your stand with signs to inform your customers.Tools. Don’t forget that you’ll need a scale if you sell by the pound, a cash box to organize your income, and bags or boxes so your customers can easily transport your products home.6. Crafts and Art: Sell Your CreativityIf you have a knack for creating beautiful things, then you were born at the right time to make some serious income from home.\\xa0The growing trend for vintage and homemade products shows no signs of stopping.\\xa0Plus, the Internet is chock full of well-known outlets for such wares.Etsy, for example, is one of the fastest growing sites that gives artists a chance to sell items at a fair price. The site boasts over\\xa040 categories, from gifts to clothes to edibles, with thousands of listings.\\xa0And the price is right; you can get your own site connected to Etsy for just 20 cents per listing.Selling on Etsy and similar sites, however, has become an art form itself, and finding success in these marketplaces takes a lot of work and planning.\\xa0Your art is already a full-time job, but you’ll need to devote plenty of time to being a smart businessperson too.\\xa0Here are some guidelines to getting started:Research. You need to know what others are selling before you decide what wares you will offer.\\xa0Lots of people sell handmade items, but those who work hard to make their items unique in some way are the ones who truly stand out.\\xa0After you’ve decided on a product, check out the other sellers on Etsy and find what they’re offering, and then figure out how you can do it differently.Commit. People who run successful shops on Etsy say that they do way more than create.\\xa0They pass out business cards everywhere they go, they blog about their site, and spend all of their free time trying to think of new ways to promote it.\\xa0In other words, to truly be a success, you have to treat it like a full-time job.Photographs. Because your customers won’t be able to touch or hold your items, you need to give them as much of a visual feel for the products as you can. You’ll do it with photographs – but not just any photos.\\xa0They have to be pleasing to the eye and make the item look fantastic.\\xa0You’ll have to learn the art of photography, and if you can’t get the hang of it, you’ll have to hire someone to do it for you.\\xa0Yes, it’s that important.Selection. One of the keys to success on Etsy is selection, according to industry insiders.\\xa0In fact, the goal of most serious shop owners is to have at least 200 items for sale.\\xa0If you’re creating all of those items yourself, that’s a pretty big time commitment.\\xa0But the more options you give to your customers, the higher the chances that you’ll make a sale.Mentorship. With sites like Etsy, it simply doesn’t make sense to reinvent the wheel when opening a shop.\\xa0Instead, look to others who have been down the path and have learned the hard way what to do – and what not to do.\\xa0Blogs like\\xa0Handmadeology and EverythingEtsy.com\\xa0offer hints and guidance for artists just looking to get started in this profitable home-based business.7. Call Centers: Sell Your Time and VoiceIf you have a great telephone voice, an ability to organize information quickly, and a quiet place in your home to work, you could make money working for a call center.What is it exactly?\\xa0Call centers cater to businesses that don’t have someone to answer their phones 24 hours a day.\\xa0The calls are routed to a call center, and then sent out to individuals who work from their homes.\\xa0These workers are equipped with computers and software to be able to answer customer’s questions.The average pay for these jobs is about $9 per hour, and some companies offer health, dental, even matching 401k plans for their employees.\\xa0Here are a few characteristics and supplies you should have:Diligence. In this industry, the line between scams and honest businesses is blurry, so you need to do your homework before accepting a position.\\xa0Call the Better Business Bureau in your area to find out if there have been any complaints filed against the company, and do an online search on their name.\\xa0Alpine Access is a well-respected company in the field, and Call Center Careers is a great place to look for legitimate call centers looking to hire.Equipment. You’ll likely have to invest in your own equipment before starting work with a call company.\\xa0You will need a computer that meets the call center’s guidelines, earphones, an Internet connection, and a landline phone to do the work required.\\xa0If you don’t already have the equipment, most companies won’t even consider your application.Grace. You’ll receive a lot of calls, and you must have the ability to handle them all smoothly.\\xa0This means that you should have a personality that can multi-task without becoming flustered.Ambition. If you prove yourself a good employee, there are opportunities for advancement in the ranks of call center employees.\\xa0You won’t even have to give up working from home to take a promotion; team leaders, managers, and account managers can all work from home.8. Sewing and Alterations: Sell Your HandiworkIf you have sewing skills, you have a wide range of options.\\xa0Just think for a moment about everything service you can provide if you have those skills.\\xa0You can do alterations and design, and you can make wedding clothes, custom-fit clothes, and special attire.You can make totes and bags, custom bedding, draperies, and upholstery cushions.\\xa0You can go so far as to sew the special canvas cushions needed for boats and yachts, or commercial needs like booth and chair cushions.In short, if you have sewing skills, you’re in demand. But there is more to sewing from your home for money than just hanging out a shingle.\\xa0Let’s take a look at some of the issues you’ll face:Equipment. The largest, and most important, piece of equipment that you’ll need is a high-quality sewing machine.\\xa0They can range in price from about $2,000 up to $6,000, and you’ll want the best one that you can afford.\\xa0Other pieces of equipment will vary, depending on what you want to specialize in.\\xa0For instance, if you intend to make custom draperies, you’ll need a serger, and a drapery steamer.Skill. If you’re going to sew for other people, your skills need to be far above average.\\xa0If you’re a beginner or an average seamstress, wait until you improve their skills before attempting to earn money in this type of business.\\xa0If people are going to trust their wedding dresses or their favorite sports jacket to you, you must be able to handle them with care and the utmost skill.Zoning. Because you’ll likely have a lot of customers in and out of your home, you should check with your local authorities to determine whether or not you need to be zoned for this type of business.Advertising. You’ll need to get the word out about your sewing business, and one of the best places to start is with your friends and neighbors.\\xa0Make sure they are all aware of your services and are willing to pass around your business cards.\\xa0In addition, you should put up fliers in local fabric stores and get to know the employees so that if someone asks, they’ll be able to refer you.\\xa0Any business needs a website, and yours will be no exception; you can put up a simple one that outlines what you do, and tells the reader what kinds of prices to expect.\\xa0Finally, by joining organizations like the American Sewing Guild, you’ll be able to stay in touch with others who are doing the same thing as you.9. Used Book Sales: Sell Your Old PaperbacksI was working at an estate sale the other weekend, and a woman came in and asked if there were any books for sale. After I pointed out the collection of books to her, she began to scan them all with a portable bar code scanner. My curiosity got the best of me and so I asked her what she was doing.She explained that she buys used books from garage and estate sales, and then turns around and sells the books for cash on sites like Amazon, Ebay, Half.com and AbeBooks. She uses the scanner to determine how long it usually takes for a specific book to sell and how much it sells for. She told me that she makes a full-time living doing this.So, I got the scoop on how to run a business of this type. Here’s what you need to know:Finances. You need to be good at quick math and be able to make quick decisions. You have to be careful how much you pay for a book, and then keep careful track of the expenses involved in selling it. For instance, when you sell on a website, they’ll take a commission from the sale. In addition, some sites, like eBay, will charge you a listing fee for each book. If you request that your money be deposited via PayPal, then you’ll be charged a transaction fee per book. If you’re not careful, the fees will quickly negate your profits.Storage. Depending on how big your business gets, you’ll need ample room to store the books. You can’t get lazy or disorganized about it, either. You have to keep the books in good condition, and you need to be able to find them when someone wants them. For instance, if you list a book in “like new” condition, and then the pages get smashed during storage, you’ll be in a bind if someone places an order before you realize what happened.Shipping. You will only have a few days to ship a book after it sells, and even less time if you agree to include two-day or overnight shipping as part of your options. And since you’ll want to save as much as you can on the shipping, you’ll have to devise a plan. Many people set aside specific days for shipping – say 3 days a week – and then make one big trip to the post office. As long as there isn’t anything else in the package, you can send books via media mail, which is the least expensive option. Finally, your books will need to be packaged in a way that they won’t get damaged in transit.Ratings. Whenever someone buys a book from you, they will have the opportunity to give the transaction a rating. This is when they’ll tell other potential buyers whether the book was in the condition that you described, whether it was mailed on time, and if your communications were pleasant and helpful. One bad rating can hamper sales, and a couple of them can downright stop them. Excel at customer service and your ratings will help your company grow.Current. It’s important that you stay current in this ever-changing business. You can do so by following some well-known blogs about the topic such as\\xa0Sell Your Books Online.10. Consulting: Sell Your KnowledgeConsultants offer their services or advice for a fee. For instance, you may help a new non-profit organization develop a plan for fundraising, and then oversee the process.\\xa0Or you may help a new company garner media attention by writing press releases and then distributing them to the proper channels.Individuals use consultants, too.\\xa0Some people use consultants for tax or financial advice, while others may pay a consultant to teach them how to set up and maintain a garden.Basically, if you have proven skills in an area, you can market yourself as a consultant and provide your services from home. Breaking in isn’t always easy, though, so consider these topics:Experience. Whatever area you want to work in as a consultant, you must be able to show clients that you’re qualified to advise them. If there are organizations related to your field, make sure that you’re a member of them.\\xa0Similarly, if you can take a course and become certified or registered in your field, do it and then add that to your credentials.Work Space. When acting as a consultant, the probability is high that clients will be visiting your home office. Therefore, you need to have a neat, professional home office that is welcoming to guests. Try to locate your work space in a quiet, even secluded, area of the house. A converted garage space with its own entrance works well, giving you a private space for work and adding to your credibility.Marketing. When operating as a consultant, you won’t necessarily be marketing your company; you’ll be marketing yourself. You’ll have to “package” yourself in a way that makes people trust you. For instance, if you’re marketing yourself as a financial consultant, ask yourself why someone would trust you with their life savings, and then figure out a way to convey that to potential clients. It might be in the form of a brochure, a portfolio, a sales letter, or all three.To get the word out about your services, you’ll have to talk to a lot of people. Attend functions where your typical client would hang out. That may mean the local agricultural department’s classes if you’re a gardening consultant, or Chamber of Commerce meetings if you’re a business consultant.11. Medical Transcription: Sell Your Computer SkillsIf you have great computer skills and can type quickly, you might be able to work from home doing medical transcription.Doctors who make audio notes on patients need someone to transcribe their notes to put them in patient files, but most doctors don’t want to pay a full-time transcriptionist. Instead, they farm out the work, and it’s a great job for good typists with a good working knowledge of health topics and medical jargon.That means you need to come with a lot of knowledge and follow this checklist:Training. To get a gig as a medical transcriptionist, you will have to take specific training. You will have to become proficient in medical terminology, and the best way to do that is to take additional courses in that area. The average course lasts from 9 to 18 months and costs about $3,000. Financial aid programs can help pay for your tuition.Breaking In. Many people find that once they’ve completed their training, getting their first job can be difficult because many companies require a minimum of two years experience.\\xa0Many newbies start out by volunteering to get some history under their belt. It’s not impossible to land a job fresh out of school, but you’ll need diligence and persistence, and probably a little luck.Equipment. When you accept a job with a reputable company, they will provide you with all the equipment you need, except for high-speed Internet. Beware of companies that require you to supply your own equipment; that’s a sign of a possible scam.Socialize. Especially when you’re getting started, you need to establish contacts who are already immersed in the business.\\xa0They can act as mentors, keep you up to date on industry changes, and even help you land your first or subsequent job. Look for the local chapter of the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI) in your area and join.Money Scams to Avoid1. Requests for MoneySure, you might expect some legitimate costs to be associated with starting a new business, like business licenses, permits, materials, or even some advertising or marketing fees.You should never have to pay someone for the privilege of selling their product for them, but that’s just what scammers tell their marks. They trick people into paying for worthless information about how to run a business or for substandard materials to use in creating a product.Some scams might involve asking you to pay for a “training” book or CD that explains how to make money in a certain business. Others charge for supposedly “exclusive” products that you’re supposed to sell at a premium.\\xa0Avoid both of these scenarios.\\xa0Remember, you should never have to pay to get a job.\\xa0And if someone asks you to, you can be sure that it’s a scam.2. Get Rich SchemesGet-rich-quick schemes get only one person rich: the schemer. Not you.\\xa0Don’t be that con artist’s next victim. If you are willing to put in the time and effort, you will have the opportunity to build a viable business or become a trusted home worker in a great business.But if you’re looking for easy money, you’ll likely just get stuck with a lot of bills and worthless information.\\xa0When websites run promotions that promise that you’ll make thousands a week with no experience and very little time, you can bet your bottom dollar that they’ll be in your wallet before you can ask the first question.3. Offers That Are Too Good to Be TrueYou might be desperate for work, but don’t necessarily jump at an opportunity that sounds too good to be true.\\xa0In my article about common Craigslist scams, I wrote about fake employers who “hire” new employees, then “accidentally” send them too much pay.\\xa0They’ll ask their victims to wire back the difference, but a few weeks later, when the bank discovers that the initial check is a fraud, the “employee” is on the hook for hundreds, sometimes even thousands of dollars.\\xa0If a job offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.These three points may seem like common sense, but the truth is that the people who run these scams are very good at what they do. They’ve been able to deceive many intelligent people because they present their “opportunities” so well that almost anyone will believe them. When you’re looking for a new job or extra income, it’s easy to get lulled in to a comfort zone where they can take advantage of you. Keep your guard up – always.Final WordFor some people, work just has to be in an office, factory, store, or any other environment that’s separate from home. Even a second job would have to be in a separate place. For others, a home office is a welcome place for a secondary or even a primary job. If you’re one of those people, you have some unique opportunities, but you also have some very particular challenges of working from home.Make sure you set a smart schedule that lets you diligently focus on your work, without throwing the rest of your life out of balance. And make sure you always keep your guard up for scams and cheats. When you’re on your own, you might have a little more freedom with your schedule, but you lose the sense of protection that a company can provide.These ideas are just ten of the great ones for earning money from your own home.\\xa0While employment opportunities are getting scarcer, isn’t it good to know that your ability to take things into your own hands is getting greater?Do you make money working from home?

As a classic example of the emerging\\xa0sharing economy, the platform connects thousands of individual and business borrowers with regular people willing to fund their loans. In doing so, it eliminates the need for borrowers to approach traditional banks and credit unions – whose lending standards may be much more stringent than Lending Club’s\\xa0– to obtain financing. Lending Club accepts borrowers with all sorts of motivations, from debt consolidation and credit card refinancing to funding a down payment on a house and covering unexpected medical expenses.For investors, Lending Club offers the opportunity to create\\xa0diversified portfolios that aren’t directly tied to bond markets. Its investments offer better yields than CDs, money market accounts, and savings accounts, though it’s critical to note that the investments are not FDIC-insured.What Is Lending Club?Lending Club competes with other P2P lending platforms, including Prosper and Peerform, as well as online direct lenders like Avant (which doesn’t follow the P2P model) and\\xa0alternative business lenders (also not P2P) such as OnDeck and Kabbage. Its original business line is unsecured personal loans for individuals. It also offers unsecured loans to business owners and two niche products: medical loans and auto refinancing loans.Lending Club’s individual loans range from $1,000 to $40,000 in size and have terms of 36 or 60 months. Borrower interest rates range\\xa0from 5.99% to 35.89%, depending on credit score, credit history, and past borrowing record with Lending Club. Lending Club doesn’t tie its rates to an index such as Libor, but it advises that rates may rise or fall depending on “market conditions” – in other words, prevailing interest rates.Lending Club’s business loans and lines of credit with terms of 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 months and principals of $5,000 to $300,000. Business products’ annualized interest rates range from 9.77% to 35.71%.See the Key Features section for more details about Lending Club’s niche products, which aren’t as popular as its unsecured personal and business loans.How It Works for InvestorsAs a Lending Club investor, you can view\\xa0Notes, or shares of unfunded loans that can be reserved for possible investment. You can reserve Notes in increments as low as $25. It’s important to note that Notes represent shares in first-issue loans that haven’t yet been funded, not already-funded instruments on a secondary market. Some Lending Club loans don’t receive enough funding to originate. If you reserve Notes in a loan that doesn’t originate, you don’t lose anything – you just get your money back to allocate to Notes in other loans.Loan PerformanceThe $25-per-loan investment\\xa0threshold\\xa0makes it easier to create a diversified loan portfolio with a relatively modest investment.\\xa0According to Lending Club’s historical data, investors with diversified loan portfolios (exposure to 100 or more loans and a mix of business and individual loans) can expect to earn annual returns between 4% and 6%. For what it’s worth, these projected returns have declined slightly over time.Annual default rates range from less than 1% for the highest-quality loan grade\\xa0(A1) to about 15% for the lowest-quality loan grade\\xa0(G5), with average annual loss rates on a diversified portfolio ranging from about 2.5% (in 2014) to 7.5% (in 2009).These default rates are subject to change over time, and it’s important to note that loans with higher yields come with a greater risk of default compared to loans with lower yields. When you look at an individual loan’s listing, you’ll see its estimated default risk, making your risk calculation that much easier.While Lending Club stresses that 99.9% of diversified loan portfolios produce positive annual returns on a consistent basis, you do risk loss of principal when investing here due to lack of deposit or investment insurance. These risks may be higher during economic downturns, when default rates are likely to increase. As always, remember that past performance is not predictive of future results.Manually Selecting Loans and InvestingIf you want to evaluate each loan you ultimately invest in, you can manually browse through loan listings. To narrow your choices,\\xa0filter\\xa0by such criteria as loan purpose, loan grade, borrower credit score, loan size, time left, rate, and term. When you view an individual loan’s listing, you see\\xa0detailed information about the loan,\\xa0including all of the filtering criteria, as well as the monthly payment, funding percentage, and number of investors currently funding.Listings\\xa0also contain information about the borrower, including his or her credit score, Lending Club grade, credit history, income, employment status, and homeowner status. And if the borrower chooses, he or she can write a detailed personal statement and loan description. You can’t change settings so that you only view personal or business loan listings at any given time, but each loan’s heading (“Personal” or “Business”) makes it easy to distinguish between the two types.If a particular loan’s listing meets your investment criteria, you can select how many $25 Notes you want to buy and\\xa0transfer funds from your Lending Club account. If your loan isn’t funded, you’ll find out within 14 days (or before, depending on when the listing expires). Funds earmarked for loans that don’t originate are returned to your account, where they become available for new investments.Automated Screening and InvestingIf you don’t have the time or patience to manually screen loans, Lending Club has an automatic screening and investing tool that allows you to quickly invest in dozens of loans without approving each one. The process is simple: You set a lower limit\\xa0on the loan grades you’re willing to accept, and Lending Club uses the cash in your account to make equal-sized investments in each new loan that’s above that limit. For instance, you can choose to only invest in loans graded A and B, or expand to include loans down to F or G, the lowest rating. If you want more control over the process, you can manually set your desired interest rate range, such as 10% to 15%.Lending Club’s automatic investing tool isn’t instantaneous. The speed\\xa0at which it invests your account’s cash depends on the availability of loans that meet your criteria and the relative amount of cash in your account. Lending Club prioritizes investments for accounts with more cash, so if you have a small balance, you may find yourself at the end of the line. Likewise, if you have narrow criteria – such as only accepting loans graded A or B – you may have to wait days or even weeks to be fully invested due to a lack of supply of suitable\\xa0loans.Receiving FundsLending Club investors receive payments at any time of the month, usually within three business days of debiting from the borrower’s bank account. Your payment is proportional to your total stake in the loan, less a 1% annual service charge.\\xa0In other\\xa0words, if you invest $500 in a loan with a 10% interest rate, you receive 9%, which is $45 annually or $3.75 per month.\\xa0Prosper and Peerform also take\\xa0a 1% service charge for each loan issued.\\xa0You also receive a proportional amount of any late fees charged to a borrower’s account, if they’re ever paid.EligibilityTo invest with Lending Club, you need to be at least 18 years old, have a valid Social Security number, and meet other financial criteria depending on your state of residence.Lending Club accepts investments from residents of most states. The exact list varies over time, so check with Lending Club directly for up-to-the-minute information.Most lenders need to meet strict financial criteria: Either gross annual income of at least $70,000 and a total net worth (not including real estate, home furnishings, and automobiles) of at least\\xa0$70,000, or a total net worth (with the same restrictions) of at least $250,000. California residents must have gross annual incomes of at least $85,000 and total net worth of at least $85,000, or a total net worth of at least $200,000.These requirements are waived for California residents who invest less than $2,500 or 10% of their net worth, whichever is less. In fact, regardless of where you live, you can’t invest more than 10% of your net worth at Lending Club.ApplicationTo apply for a Lending Club investor account, you need to provide your current contact information, Social Security number, and bank account information (for making deposits and withdrawals into and out of your Lending Club account). Lending Club uses the information you provide to verify your identity and bank account, a process that typically takes one to three business days.Once approved, you need to deposit at least $1,000 to fund your account. The minimum investment per note is $25. You can’t buy Notes unless you have sufficient funds in your Lending Club account. To ensure that’s never a problem, consider setting up automatic deposits from your tied bank account in the amount and frequency of your choosing.How It Works for BorrowersHere’s a look at how the borrowing process works for individuals and business owners. See the Key Features section for details on Lending Club’s two niche products.Loan Characteristics and RestrictionsIf Lending Club chooses to approve your application, it assigns a loan grade – measuring the likelihood that you’ll default on the loan – and interest rate to your loan. Loan grades include a letter (A – G) and number (1 – 5).Individual borrowers rated A1, the highest-quality grade, can expect interest rates of around 5.99% on the 36-month loan. Those rated G5 – the lowest rating\\xa0– can expect rates of 35.89% on the 36-month loan. Generally, borrowers with good or excellent credit can expect rates below 15%, while borrowers with mediocre credit can expect rates between 15% and the upper rate limit. Grading and interest rates are similar for business borrowers.FundingIf you qualify for a loan with Lending Club, you’ll receive multiple offers. Once you choose the best-looking offer, complete the online application, and verify your identity, Lending Club will start looking for investors to fund the loan. From start to finish, the entire process can take as little as a week or as long as 45 days – it depends how smoothly the underwriting process goes and how attractive your financial profile appears to investors.Lending Club works with a mix of individual and institutional investors, so it’s impossible to predict in advance exactly who will fund your loan. Once your loan is funded, the principal is deposited into your verified bank account within one to four business days, depending on your bank.The personal loan origination fee ranges from 1% and 6%, depending on your loan grade\\xa0and loan term. It’s automatically added to your principal and begins accruing interest immediately.Origination fees on business loans range from 1% to 6%, depending on your grade (term doesn’t matter). These fees are deducted from the total amount of your loan, so the actual amount you receive may be up to 6% lower than your requested amount.RepaymentLending Club requires monthly repayments of a fixed amount. It automatically debits your bank account on the same day of the month, emailing a reminder a few days before to ensure sufficient funds in the account. If you’re more than 15 days late due to insufficient funds, you’ll be charged the greater of $15 or 5% of the total loan payment as a late payment fee, which doesn’t reduce your principal balance.Loans more than 30 days past due may be reported to a collection agency. You can manually make additional payments or pay off your loan in full at any time with no prepayment penalties.EligibilityPersonal Loans Though Lending Club doesn’t release all the details of its proprietary application and screening process, borrowers with credit scores below 600 generally aren’t eligible. Additionally, borrowers must be at least 18 years old, have U.S. citizenship or long-term residency, reside in one of the states where Lending Club operates, and have a verified bank account. To verify your bank account, Lending Club makes two small trial deposits and asks you to confirm their amounts in your Lending Club account.When evaluating an application, Lending Club looks at factors like credit score, credit history (length and activity), debt-to-income ratio, employment status, income, and homeownership status. Having a higher credit score, lower debt to income ratio, steady employment, and solid income increases your chances of approval and reduces your loan’s interest rate.Business Loans Business borrowers are subject to the same geographical, age, and citizenship requirements as individual borrowers. Additionally, business loan applicants must own at least 20% of a\\xa0business\\xa0with\\xa0$75,000 or more in annual sales, have been a 20%-plus owner for at least two years, and be authorized to borrow on behalf of the business.When evaluating an application, Lending Club considers factors such as the business’s credit utilization, past payment history, credit history (length and activity), and cash flow. Businesses with longer credit histories, more robust cash flows, and timely past payment histories are more likely to be approved and enjoy a lower rate.Application and ApprovalTo apply for a Lending Club loan, you need to provide basic contact information, bank account information, and your Social Security number. You also need to specify the desired amount, term (36 or 60 months), and purpose (such as debt consolidation, home improvement, and medical expenses) of your loan.Lending Club verifies your bank account by making trial deposits, which can take one to three business days. It then conducts a thorough credit check, including a thorough evaluation of your personal or business credit history, using one or more credit scores and reports from the major credit reporting bureaus.If you’re an individual borrower, Lending Club also verifies your employment status and income by requesting pay stubs or income tax statements and contacting your employer. This process can take up to 14 business days, though Lending Club says most applications are either approved or denied within seven business days (not including funding time). If you’re self-employed, Lending Club may request more documentation around your income and finances, lengthening the process.Key FeaturesLending Club’s additional features include:Retirement AccountsYou can set up a Lending Club account as a traditional or Roth IRA. Having a retirement account with Lending Club doesn’t affect your ability to have a regular account, meaning you can set up multiple Lending Club accounts if desired.Custodial AccountsIf you’re the parent or legal guardian of a minor child, you can also set up a custodial Lending Club account and control it until the child reaches age 21.Note TradingLending Club has a partnership with Folio Investing\\xa0that allows investors to buy and sell existing Notes on a secondary market. Depending on the borrower’s Lending Club rating, general credit history, and repayment history with Lending Club, Notes may trade at a premium or discount to regular face value ($25).To execute Note trades, you need to be approved for\\xa0a Folio Investing account. You can apply through Lending Club’s website. All transactions incur a 1% commission, payable to Folio. Note that Lending Club advises borrowers to “be prepared to hold any Note you purchase through to its maturity” – in other words, not to expect that you’ll be able to sell your Notes with Folio.Multiple Outstanding Loans for BorrowersLending Club borrowers can\\xa0have up to two\\xa0outstanding loans at once. Cumulative balance restrictions apply – check with Lending Club for details. And note, before applying for a second loan, you must demonstrate consistent patterns of timely repayment and remain in good standing with Lending Club.Patient Solutions LoansLending Club’s Patient Solutions vertical is a financing solution designed specifically for medical providers looking to offer a (relatively) low-cost financing option to\\xa0 their patients. It’s especially useful for providers that practice concierge medicine or eschew third-party payers (insurance and government-run reimbursement schemes such as Medicaid) altogether, since their patients typically face hefty out-of-pocket costs that require private financing.Patient Solutions loans are underwritten on a borrower-specific basis, and approval is not guaranteed. As with other Lending Club loans, patients need to have solid credit to secure approval. Note that not all specialties are covered – Lending Club caters to dentists and certain medical specialists, such as bariatric surgeons and hair restoration specialists. This is subject to change, so check with Lending Club for up-to-date information.Patient Solutions loans come in two flavors:Extended Plans: Rates range from 3.99% to 24.99% APR, depending on borrower credit and loan term. Terms range from 24 to 84 months. Principal ranges from $2,000 to $50,000. Specialties include dental, fertility, hair restoration, and weight loss.True No-Interest Loans: Rates stay at 0% APR for up to 24 months, then rise to 26.99% APR, depending on loan terms and borrower credit. Principal ranges from $499 to $32,000. Specialties include dental and hair restoration.Auto Refinancing LoansLending Club brokers auto refinancing loans for car owners with rides in reasonably good shape: 10 years old or newer and fewer than 120,000 miles on the odometer. The loans themselves can come from one of several outside lenders, not Lending Club itself (or its individual investors).Auto refinancing loan rates range from 2.24% to 24.99% APR, depending on the original rate and borrower credit. There are no origination, prepayment, or application fees, and the loans are generally originated much faster than traditional Lending Club loans. Loans need to be at least three months old and have at least 24 payments remaining. Principals range from $5,000 to $55,000.You Might Also Like: Luxury doesn’t have to cost a fortune.

Lower Interest Rates for BorrowersThough many factors influence Lending Club’s interest rates,\\xa0its rates tend to be lower for borrowers with similar risk profiles. And Lending Club’s overall rate range\\xa0is more favorable for borrowers than Prosper’s.\\xa0Avant’s loans are much more expensive across the board, with effective annual rates ranging from about 30% to 90% (though shorter terms may reduce borrowers’ total interest payments on that platform). In fairness, Avant caters to borrowers with poorer credit.2. Minimum Personal Loan\\xa0Is $1,000As an individual borrower, Lending Club lets you\\xa0take out loans as small as $1,000. This can be useful if you need extra cash to pay down a credit card or medical bill, but don’t want to be saddled with the high monthly repayment that a larger loan would bring. With Prosper, you can’t get a loan smaller than $2,000.3. Business Loans Available Up to $300,000Lending Club offers loans of up to $300,000 to entrepreneurs and established business owners. This is higher than some smaller competitors, including some focused specifically on small businesses.4. Lower Origination Fees Than Some CompetitorsFor some borrowers, Lending Club’s origination fees\\xa0offer a better deal than other online lenders. For instance, Lending Club borrowers with an A rating pay origination fees between 1% and 3% on 36-month loans, depending on their sub-rating. At Prosper, A-rated borrowers pay origination fees of 4% for loans of the same term length. For 60-month loans, A-rated Lending Club borrowers pay a 3% origination fee, while similarly rated Prosper borrowers pay 5%.5. Lower Default RatesAmong competing P2P platforms, Lending Club historically offers the lowest rates of borrower default. Since 2010, its default rate has been anywhere from 0.5% to 4% lower than Prosper’s. This means that you may see fewer losses as an investor. Just remember that past performance is not predictive of future results, and that default rates typically increase during economic downturns.6. Niche Solutions for Patients and Car OwnersLending Club’s Patient Solutions and auto refinancing loans are great for folks preoccupied with hefty medical bills or legacy car loans issued when rates were much higher (or their credit was much poorer). Since they’re more narrowly tailored to specific borrower sets, they tend to be faster to underwrite as well – great news for people who need relief yesterday.Disadvantages1. Notes Only Available in $25 IncrementsLending Club requires you to buy Notes in increments of $25, with a minimum investment of $25 in each loan. In other words, you can invest $100 in a particular loan, but not $95 or $105. This limits your flexibility relative to other P2P lending platforms such as Prosper, which lets you invest in any amount above $25.2. Financial Restrictions for InvestorsLending Club’s financial restrictions for investors – limiting total investments to 10% or less of net worth and requiring minimum net worth or income thresholds – excludes some potential\\xa0lenders from participating. While Prosper investors face similar restrictions if they live in states that impose them by law, it doesn’t impose them across the board like Lending Club. For investors with modest incomes or net worths, this means that Prosper may be the only option.3.\\xa0Not Suitable for Borrowers With Middling or Impaired CreditLending Club is designed for borrowers with decent to excellent credit. While your financial profile doesn’t need to be perfect to score a higher-interest loan here, you’re unlikely to be approved for a loan at any rate with a credit score south of 600. If your credit is impaired, look into a secured credit card instead. Avoid payday loans and other forms of predatory lending – they’re usually more trouble than they’re worth.You Might Also Like: In the market for a secured credit card? Check out our roundup of the best secured credit cards on the market today.Final WordLike other ambassadors for the sharing economy, peer-to-peer lending platforms such as Lending Club increase efficiency and transparency by cutting out the middle man – in this case, banks and other traditional lending institutions. Like the ridesharing companies forcing the taxi industry to rethink its business model, P2P lenders could force positive change in a financial industry that’s had trouble making new friends since the financial crisis.And that’s not the only potential benefit. By directly connecting regular people willing to invest or borrow from their neighbors, P2P lending establishes personal connections that can’t exist between traditional financial institutions – even community banks and credit unions – and their borrowers. Stronger, more constructive communities could be the real legacy of Lending Club and its peers.VerdictLending Club is the most popular P2P lending platform around, connecting thousands of individual and business borrowers with willing lenders. Borrowers enjoy somewhat lower interest rates and higher borrowing limits than competitors such as Prosper and Avant, but an inflexible partial funding requirement are unattractive. For investors, lower default rates are offset by financial restrictions that limit participation.Score4.3 out of 5 stars: Lending Club’s higher borrowing limits and business loan availability enhance its attractiveness for borrowers, while lower default rates are good for investors. Negatives include\\xa0financial thresholds\\xa0for participating investors and partial funding issues for borrowers.Related57K Views24 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInRating: 3.9Updated: November 9, 2017VERDICT Apply NowLending ClubLending Club is a great alternative investment opportunity for qualified, risk-tolerant investors who care about giving their fellow consumers a leg up in the financial rat race. Likewise, it’s a more human way for everyday borrowers to get liquidity in (relatively) short order.Lending Club does have some shortcomings. It’s most definitely not suitable for borrowers with impaired credit, nor for investors without ample (and demonstrable) assets and income. The platform itself is also a bit wonky. But, overall, there’s a lot to like here.Score: 3.9 out of 5 starsKey benefits include relatively low interest rates (compared with peers), low origination fees, high borrowing limits for businesses, low borrowing minimums for individuals, lower default rates than some competitors, and niche loans for certain borrowers.Notable drawbacks include inflexible Note sizes, bias toward prime-credit borrowers, and asset and income restrictions for investors.In sum, Lending Club is a solid choice for investors and borrowers alike. Just do your due diligence ahead of time and make sure you know what you’re getting into before you finalize your application.Related ArticlesProsper Review - Online Loan Marketplace for Peer-to-Peer Lending SoFi Review - Refinance Your Student Loans Peer-to-Peer What Is the Sharing Economy - Example Companies, Definition, Pros & Cons What Are Debt Consolidation Loans - Benefits, Risks & Alternatives How to Get Money to Start a Business - 8 Startup Financing Options 10 Reasons Why You Should NOT Lend Money to Friends & Family FacebookTweetPinLinkedInGoogle+StumbleUponPrintEmailCategories: Credit and Debt, Loans, ReviewsBrian MartucciBrian Martucci is a blogger-journalist who writes about frugal living, entrepreneurship, and innovative ideas.

USAA itself\\xa0– the parent company of these subsidiaries –\\xa0is member-owned, structured under Texas law as an inter-insurance exchange. This is a cooperative model, as opposed to a traditional corporation. All members can purchase insurance through this structure. As a member who owns a slice of the company, you’re eligible\\xa0to receive a share of USAA’s annual profits.Because USAA has only 20 or so offices in North America and Europe (London and Frankfurt, Germany), USAA conducts most of its business online or over the phone. If you’re a member of the military or are part of a military family, USAA is for you – literally.Eligibility: Who Can Join USAA?Though USAA has changed a lot since the 1920s, it retains an unwavering focus on its original niche: service members and their families. Unfortunately, this means that huge swathes of the U.S. population don’t qualify for membership.The following groups are eligible to join USAA:Active-Duty, Retired, and Honorably Separated Personnel. If you’re a current or former service member without a dishonorable discharge, you’re eligible for membership.Cadets and Midshipmen. This includes cadets and midshipmen at service academies and individuals participating in the ROTC program.Children of Members. Children of military personnel and their spouses can become USAA members.Current and Former Spouses of Military Personnel. If your spouse is eligible to join USAA, you are as well. This benefit continues after divorce or\\xa0your spouse’s death.What Can Nonmembers Get From USAA?Even if you don’t quality for membership, you may be able to use some of USAA’s products and services, such as investment accounts, life insurance, and shopping discounts. However, other types of insurance, loans, banking products, and credit cards aren’t available to nonmembers. Since USAA’s\\xa0policies regarding nonmembers are\\xa0subject to change, it’s best to check directly with USAA before attempting to purchase any of its products or services as a nonmember.USAA’s Personal Banking ProductsChecking AccountsUSAA offers two checking products:Secure Checking. Secure Checking has a $25 minimum opening deposit, no monthly maintenance fee, surcharge-free access to 60,000 partner ATMs, free, unlimited funds transfers to any account at another institution.Secure Checking Plus.\\xa0Secure Checking Plus has a $50 minimum deposit and a $9.95 monthly maintenance fee. It also comes with an ID theft protection and credit monitoring package from Experian, which includes a quarterly credit score and report, and financial reimbursement of up to $1 million in the event of an identity breach. Surcharge-free ATM access and unlimited funds transfers are included.Savings AccountsUSAA offers two free savings accounts:USAA Savings.\\xa0Savings has a minimum opening deposit\\xa0of $25 and an interest rate range of 0.05% to 0.15% APY, depending on your balance. ATM access and bank account transfers are free.Performance First. Performance First has a minimum opening deposit\\xa0of $10,000 and rates between 0.05% and 0.30% APY, depending on your balance. ATM access and bank account transfers are free.Credit CardsIn partnership with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, USAA offers multiple\\xa0credit cards. Only one, a secured credit card, comes with an annual fee.The American Express card comes with a cash back rewards program. The Visa and MasterCard products come with travel and shopping rewards. APRs are subject to change with prevailing interest rates and your starting rate may vary depending on your creditworthiness. Check with USAA for up-to-the-minute details.CDsUSAA offers three different types of CDs:Fixed Rate. Terms range from 18 months to seven years. Rates increase in proportion to the CD’s term, with the 18-month product yielding 0.76% APY and the seven-year product yielding 1.06% APY.Variable Rate.\\xa0The variable rate CD comes with terms of 6 or 12 months, though the rate can vary based on fluctuations in prevailing consumer interest rates.\\xa0However, USAA doesn’t say how the rate is recalculated or give a range that it can vary within. It’s currently set at 0.46% APY for both products.Adjustable Rate. This CD comes with terms of three, four, and five years, with rates ranging from .12% to .43% (depending on term length and CD size). If rates rise, you have the option to raise your CD’s rate once during its term.USAA’s Investment ProductsTraditional Brokerage Accounts (General Investing)You can trade stocks, ETFs, options, mutual funds, and CDs\\xa0in USAA’s traditional brokerage accounts, which come with no minimum opening deposit.Stock trading commissions are normally $8.95 per trade. Options trades are $8.95 plus $0.75 per contract. Higher-volume traders may qualify for discounted commissions, but you’ll want to check with USAA for updated information.USAA has dozens of no-transaction-fee funds. No-load transaction fee funds typically carry $45 commissions, so they’re not ideal for small-dollar investing.Retirement AccountsUSAA offers traditional and Roth IRAs, as well as SEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs. These come with the same commission and fee scale as USAA’s brokerage accounts. They also offer access to USAA’s annuities, mutual funds, and managed portfolios.Managed PortfoliosYou can invest in three broad asset types through USAA:USAA: Primarily uses USAA mutual funds and fund managers. Fund expenses are generally higher here than with the other two asset types.Marketplace: Uses a range of third-party funds for greater issuer diversification. Some USAA mutual funds are included. Pricing is intermediate.ETF: Uses exchange-traded funds for lower expenses and greater diversification. Index funds feature prominently here. Pricing is moderate.A fourth option, Custom, is available to investors with more than $500,000 in assets under management.Regardless of asset type, you can select from one of six model portfolios, ranging from conservative to very aggressive. Conservative portfolios reserve greater allocations for fixed-income securities and other relatively low-risk investments, while aggressive portfolios reserve greater allocations for growth stocks and other higher-risk investments. The minimum investment in all cases is $25,000.Annual management fees start at 1.10% and decline as assets under management increase. Credits may further reduce these fees, but they’re applied on a case-by-case basis:Under $125,000: 1.10%Up to $250,000: 1.00%Up to $500,000: 0.85%Up to $1 Million: 0.75%Up to $2 Million: 0.65%Up to $10 Million: 0.50%Above $10 Million: NegotiableThis particular step structure is a bit more manageable for lower-asset investors than some competing managed investment options.More About USAA Mutual FundsUSAA administers dozens of its own mutual funds. These range from conservative options such as money market funds and short-term bond funds, to more aggressive options such as small cap stock funds and a fund that tracks the performance of the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100.On the conservative side, expense ratios tend to be less than 1% – for instance, the USAA Government Security Fund’s ratio is 0.41%.\\xa0By contrast, the small cap stock fund has an expense ratio of 1.25%. These expenses are subject to change over time.You can buy USAA-administered funds through your brokerage or retirement accounts. Remember that you also have access to 6,000 funds from other issuers (such as Vanguard and T. Rowe Price) through those accounts.TrustsUSAA offers managed trust portfolios with a minimum size of $500,000.\\xa0Their assets are professionally managed by an in-house trustee in coordination with third-party advisors (when necessary) and your attorney. They’re great options for parents or guardians seeking to establish trust funds for minor children and future beneficiaries.AnnuitiesUSAA provides immediate (Single Premium) and deferred annuities (Flexible Retirement and Extended Guarantee).In exchange for a one-time\\xa0investment, the immediate annuity makes fixed monthly payouts\\xa0for either a preselected period (such as 10 years) or the remainder of your\\xa0life, with no maintenance fees. The deferred annuities allow your money to grow tax-free until you retire, also with no maintenance fees. The minimum investment is $5,000 for the Flexible Retirement annuity and $20,000 for the Extended Guarantee annuity.APYs\\xa0on the deferred annuities range from 1% to 2.35%, depending on your location and the amount invested. USAA doesn’t offer specific rate information for the immediate annuities.529 Accounts (Education Savings)USAA’s 529 savings accounts allow savings earmarked for higher\\xa0educational expenses (such as tuition, room and board, and\\xa0books and supplies) to grow without incurring a federal tax liability (if used for eligible expenses).\\xa0The minimum opening deposit is $250, or $50 if you set up a recurring monthly deposit of at least $50. These products may not be available in all states, so it’s best to check with USAA first.USAA’s Loan ProductsMortgage LoansUSAA offers home purchase and refinance mortgage loans. These\\xa0come in five varieties: fixed rate, 5/1 adjustable rate (ARM), VA loans, FHA loans, and jumbo mortgages. All except the adjustable rate mortgage come with terms of 15 or 30 years (the 5/1 ARM is only available as a 30-year product). Rates range from Libor plus 2.5% on the 15-year VA loan, to Libor plus 4.75% on the 30-year fixed loan. They’re subject to change without warning, so it’s best to check with USAA early in the buying process.Home Equity LoansYou can borrow against the value of your home with a USAA home equity line of credit.For lines between $25,000 (the minimum amount) and $75,000, rates range between Libor plus 4.25% and Libor plus 8.25%, depending on your credit score and whether you choose a fixed (higher starting rate) or variable rate. For lines of more than $75,000, rates range between Libor plus 4.25% and Libor plus 7.75%. These rates are subject to change without notice.Your line can be up to 80% of the value of your home. All USAA home equity lines of credit come with a five-year draw period, during which you can request funds and only pay back the accrued interest, and a 15-year repayment period, during which you must repay the borrowed amount in its entirety, plus interest.Auto LoansUSAA offers three types of auto loans: new car, used car, and refinance. New car loan APRs start at 2.99% (2.49% if you’re using USAA Car Buying Service – see more on that below) and increase from there. The exact rate depends on your credit history and your location. Used car APRs start at 3.49% (2.99% with USAA Car Buying Service) and increase from there. USAA doesn’t provide an upper loan limit on either loan type.The company’s refinance loans start at 2.99% for cars less than two years old and 3.49% for cars older than that.Pro Tip: Not sure whether to buy pre-owned or right off the assembly line? Check out our detailed post on how to determine whether to buy a new or used car.Other Vehicle LoansUSAA also offers loans on RVs, boats, and motorcycles. Rates on these loans start between 5% and 6% APR, depending on the vehicle type, your credit history, and location, but are subject to change without warning.Personal LoansUSAA provides unsecured personal loans in amounts as low as $2,500. Rates start at about 10% APR and go up from there, depending on your credit score and the amount of the loan. The company doesn’t provide an upper limit for its rates or principal\\xa0amounts, but its lending standards\\xa0get stricter as the principal increases.USAA’s Insurance ProductsAuto InsuranceUSAA offers auto insurance to members in all 50 U.S. states and some overseas jurisdictions (typically where the U.S. military has a presence). It has a lot of the bells and whistles you’d find with other major insurers like Progressive and State Farm: accident forgiveness, safe driver discounts, family and bundle discounts, customer loyalty discounts, roadside assistance, and more.Unique USAA auto insurance perks include a 15% discount for policyholders who store their vehicles on-base and\\xa0an installment payment option\\xa0that can be tailored to military pay scales. For instance, officers-in-training may be able to defer some of their premiums until they earn their higher paying officer commissions.Other Vehicle\\xa0InsuranceThe company also offers insurance on other vehicles, including boats, RVs, motorcycles, planes, and classic cars. Premiums and terms vary by vehicle type and policyholder.Home and Property InsuranceUSAA offers several types of insurance for your home and property: homeowners’ insurance, renters insurance, and rental/investment property insurance (for landlords).Flood InsuranceThrough a subsidiary, USAA General Indemnity Company, USAA offers flood insurance policies underwritten by the National Flood Insurance Program. There are two types of policies: Standard for homeowners in high-risk areas, and the lower-cost Preferred Risk for homeowners in low- to medium-risk areas. Both policies offer up to $250,000 in coverage for your home and up to $100,000 in coverage for the home’s contents.Life InsuranceUSAA administers four different life insurance products: military term (for members of the military only), level term (for everyone else), universal life, and whole life.Both term life products come with terms of as little as 10 years and as long as 30 years. Premiums vary by age, location, and policy size.Both the universal and whole policies build cash value over time,\\xa0which you can\\xa0borrow against. Unlike most life insurance policies issued to civilians, USAA’s policies don’t limit or withhold death benefits\\xa0in the event that the policyholder dies in a violent conflict – a necessary move in light of its customer base. With a USAA policy, your payout is the same whether you die of natural causes or in a war zone.Health InsuranceThe USAA Health Insurance Marketplace lets members choose from a variety of health, dental, vision, long-term care, and other policies offered by private insurance companies (such as Cigna) and the military’s TRICARE health insurance system. USAA doesn’t actually administer these plans itself, but its members\\xa0may secure lower premiums on them due to the company’s negotiating power.USAA also offers low-cost Health Expense Plans. They’re designed to cover catastrophic care and some preventive care expenses, but they may not meet minimum coverage requirements set forth in the Affordable Care Act. Still, for middle-income consumers, the savings may be worth incurring a tax penalty under the ACA.Umbrella InsuranceUSAA’s umbrella insurance policies offer additional protection for problems that might not be covered by other types of insurance, such as legal and judgment costs if you’re sued for libel or slander. The standard coverage amount is $1 million. Premiums start at $19 per month.Other USAA Products and ServicesCar Buying Services and BenefitsUSAA’s website has a powerful car-finding feature known as the Car Buying Service. It’s similar to what you’d find on AutoTrader or Cars.com – use\\xa0it to find your preferred vehicle make and model at a dealer in your area.USAA also has a network of USAA Preferred Dealers that offers special car-buying discounts (according to USAA, these range from $1,000 to $5,500 off MSRP for new cars, but they’re subject to change at any time). And if you buy a vehicle through one and then find a lower advertised price at another dealer within four days of purchase, USAA will refund the difference.Credit Monitoring and Identity ProtectionWhether or not they have a financial account with the company, USAA members can purchase two different credit monitoring and ID protection packages:CreditCheck Monitoring:\\xa0$7.95 per month and also included in the Secure Premium Checking Account. It includes\\xa0 one credit score and one report per month from Experian.CreditCheck Monitoring Premium: $12.95 per month. Includes one credit score and report per month from all three major consumer credit reporting bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax.Both plans include historical reports and fraud investigation services.Shopping and Service DiscountsUSAA offers discounts on\\xa0products and services through partnerships with individual companies. For instance, members get special deals (USAA doesn’t specify how much) on home security systems with ADT, storage systems with PODS, and flowers with FTD.Subscriber’s Account Distributions and AllocationsEvery member who purchases a USAA insurance policy receives a Subscriber’s\\xa0Account. Administered by the company’s board of directors, this account holds a portion of USAA’s capital reserves. This is a key feature of USAA’s legal structure: As a cooperative organization, every member literally owns a piece of the company, and the Subscriber’s Account represents that ownership.Your Subscriber’s Account balance is proportional to the total amount of insurance premiums you’ve paid, with a percentage\\xa0of each premium payment deposited\\xa0into the account. The percentage is determined by the board of directors, may vary year to year, and isn’t public.\\xa0This is USAA’s money, so you can’t withdraw it. But if the company turns a profit and meets financial\\xa0performance goals set by the board of directors (variable from year to year), it may distribute a portion of your Subscriber’s Account balance to you (by paper check or direct deposit into your USAA bank account) in December of each year. The distribution amount varies from year to year and is based on the company’s financial performance, your account balance, and your lifetime premium payments.Once you’ve been a member for 40 years, you become eligible for an additional\\xa0Senior Bonus, payable in February of each year. The amount of this extra bonus\\xa0is subject to the same conditions as the regular bonus.Advantages1. Huge Range of Products and Services Under One RoofCompared to many other financial institutions that do the bulk of their business online, USAA offers an impressive lineup of products and services: most types of insurance, brokerage and retirement accounts, checking and savings accounts, and several types of loans. It also offers value-added perks like rebates on auto and home purchases, discounts on other purchases, and ID theft protection.With USAA, it’s possible to take care of most or all of you financial needs under one roof. By contrast, Capital One 360 offers lots of banking products and access to an online brokerage in Sharebuilder, but no loans or insurance products. Allstate provides a similarly comprehensive range of insurance products, but no banking or brokerage accounts.2. Life Insurance Policies Don’t Include a War ClauseUSAA life insurance policies don’t withhold or restrict death benefits for policyholders who die in war or violent conflict. If you’re an active-duty servicemember who dies in overseas fighting, your family will receive the same benefits as if you had died peacefully on U.S. soil.By contrast, most other life insurance issuers\\xa0limit payouts in cases of conflict-related death. Active-duty servicemembers who face overseas deployment may have to pay higher premiums.3. The Potential for Annual\\xa0Profit Distributions to MembersIn addition to rebates and discounts on auto and home insurance and other purchases, USAA returns capital to its members in other ways. When you buy an insurance policy from the company, you automatically receive a Subscriber’s Account that holds a portion of USAA’s capital. If the company meets\\xa0the annual financial performance goals set by the board of directors, you’re entitled to receive an annual payout from this amount that could range from a few dollars to several hundred.If you’ve been a member for more than 40 years, you’re entitled to an even juicier annual payout. Most traditional insurance companies, such as Allstate and Progressive, aren’t member-owned and thus don’t offer annual distributions to members.4. Access to Flood InsuranceThe FEMA-run\\xa0National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)\\xa0underwrites all flood insurance policies issued in the United States, so many insurance companies (including powerhouses such as Allstate and Geico) don’t bother to offer their customers the opportunity to obtain flood insurance, instead directing them to\\xa0NFIP. By contrast, USAA’s members can buy NFIP-underwritten policies directly through one of the company’s subsidiaries. This allows you to conduct all your insurance business through one insurer.5. Lots of Credit Card OptionsUSAA has an unusually rich, varied slate of rewards credit cards. Whether you’re looking for a basic low APR interest credit card or a premium cash back product, you can find it here. This is a big advantage over smaller banks and credit unions, which typically offer just one or two token credit cards – forcing customers seeking higher-end products to flee to the competition.You Might Also Like: Trying to wrap your head around the immense selection of credit cards on the market today? Check out our roundup of the top cash back credit cards for more ideas.Disadvantages1. Many Products Aren’t Available to NonmembersSince it restricts membership to military personnel and qualifying family members, USAA’s full product lineup isn’t available to most Americans. As a nonmember, you may be eligible to open a brokerage account, purchase life insurance, and take advantage of its shopping discounts. But USAA reserves the right to close these services to nonmembers, so it’s best to check with the company before making a decision. Eligibility is much less restrictive at insurance providers and financial institutions that aren’t member-owned, such as Allstate and Capital One 360.2. CD and Savings Yields Aren’t Competitive With Other Online BanksUSAA’s CD and savings account rates tend to be on the low end, especially compared to online banks like Ally Bank and EverBank.\\xa0Savings yields top out around 0.3% APY, and that decidedly mediocre rate requires a hefty $1 million balance to trigger.Most yields on USAA’s CDs with multi-year terms top out below 1.00%. The highest available USAA CD yield is 1.06% – and that’s only for customers willing to lock up their funds for seven years.USAA’s yields have remained flat or declined slightly even as prevailing rates have ticked up, exacerbating the deficiency. If you’re chasing yields on FDIC-insured savings products, you definitely want to look beyond USAA.3. Customer Service Is Cumbersome and ConfusingUSAA has live customer service professionals, but reaching them can be tricky.\\xa0Though there’s a main number – (210) 531-USAA – with a touch-tone menu to direct you to the right department, the sheer number of departments makes this time-consuming. So USAA advises you to call your desired division (IRAs, mortgage, auto loans, and so on) directly.However, this requires you to look up the pertinent number in its online directory, which can also take time. And since its offices are closed on the weekend, calling on Monday can be stressful and time-consuming – so much so that USAA advises members\\xa0to call Tuesday through Friday instead.\\xa0By contrast, Ally Bank’s customer service team is available 24/7, by phone, often with wait times of just a few minutes.Separately, USAA doesn’t have a live chat feature on its website – if you don’t want to call, you need to email a customer service professional and wait hours (or days, depending on volume) for a response. Ally and other online banks have live web chat.4. Website Is Dense and Difficult to NavigateUSAA’s website is difficult to navigate, and its most important parts – including drop-down menus – are clogged with small text. This makes it difficult to use on a mobile device. The design has become more responsive since I’ve been watching USAA, but it’s still light-years behind the most mobile-friendly financial institutions out there.Final WordServing in the military is an honorable calling that demands tremendous sacrifice. If you’re an active-duty, retired, or honorably separated servicemember, or are related to someone who fits that bill, you may be eligible for membership in USAA. With perks that aren’t available through many other banks and insurance companies, there are plenty of reasons to join.However, USAA isn’t for everyone, as only a handful of its products are available to nonmembers. And though the company has flirted with expanding eligibility requirements in the past, including a brief period when it welcomed employees of the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies, it appears likely to prioritize its core constituency – the military – for the foreseeable future.Related11.2K Views24 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInRating: 4.3Updated: November 11, 2017VERDICTUSAAUSAA has a wide range of insurance and financial products available online. It also offers support for members looking to\\xa0save money on the purchase of a house, car, and various other services. But with\\xa0restrictive eligibility requirements, it’s not an option for most Americans. And since you’re likely to do most of your business with USAA online, it would be nice if they invested more in the website, customer service, and other aspects of the user experience.Score: 4.3 out of 5 starsKey benefits include a huge range of financial products and solutions, no war clause in life insurance policies, potential for profit distributions through subscriber accounts, access to flood insurance, and lots of credit card options.Notable drawbacks include mediocre savings and CD yields, limited product availability and eligibility requirements, confusing customer service, and website issues.Overall, USAA has something for everyone, as long as they have Armed Forces experience or close family ties to someone else who does. Don’t be afraid to shop around elsewhere – not all USAA products are market-leading.Related ArticlesUSAA Rate Advantage MasterCard Review - Low APR Credit Card for Military Members USAA Platinum Visa Rewards Credit Card Review USAA American Express Rewards Credit Card Review USAA World MasterCard Rewards Credit Card Review USAA Cash Rewards World MasterCard Review - 1.25% Cash Back on All Purchases USAA Cash Rewards American Express Card Review - 2.25% Cash Back on Gas & Groceries FacebookTweetPinLinkedInGoogle+StumbleUponPrintEmailCategories: Banking, Insurance, Investing, Lifestyle, Military, Money Management, ReviewsBrian MartucciBrian Martucci is a blogger-journalist who writes about frugal living, entrepreneurship, and innovative ideas.

It offers a checking account, savings accounts, money market accounts, CDs, and retirement products, all of which are FDIC insured. This segment of the company competes with online banking heavyweights such as Ally Bank and EverBank.Key FeaturesCashBack Checking AccountDiscover Bank’s CashBack Checking account is available to anyone with a Discover-branded credit card or existing Discover Bank account, such as a savings or money market account. It requires a minimum opening deposit of $25, but\\xa0no minimum daily balance or monthly fee. It also comes with 50 free checks and offers fee-free ATM transactions at more than 60,000 ATMs in Discover’s U.S. network.The real benefit of CashBack Checking is its rewards program. Every qualifying debit card purchase earns 1% cash back, up to $3,000 in purchases ($30 in rewards) each month.\\xa0You can redeem your reward balance at any time and in any amount as a cash deposit into your CashBack Checking account or as a statement credit on your Discover credit card, if you have one.\\xa0Rewards never expire.Savings AccountsDiscover Bank offers a savings account with a current APR of 1.20%.\\xa0There’s no minimum deposit amount and no need to maintain a minimum balance after your initial deposit. Outbound transfers are capped at six per month, with Discover\\xa0assessing a fee of $15 for each additional one – there’s no limit on inbound transfers. If you attempt an outbound transfer but don’t have enough money in your account, you’re charged $30 per attempt.Money Market AccountsDiscover Bank’s money market account currently has an APR of 1.05% for balances less than $100,000, a minimum opening deposit of $2,500, and a minimum daily balance of $2,500. If your account drops below $2,500 at any point during a statement cycle, you are charged $10 at that cycle’s end. Money market accounts come with free checks and a free debit card, but are subject to the same six-withdrawal-per-period limit as savings accounts. Excess withdrawals also cost $15 per item, and non-sufficient funds (NSF)\\xa0transactions cost $30 per item. Any balance over $100,000 earns an APR of 1.10%.CDsDiscover Bank offers 12 separate CDs, with terms of 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 84, and 120 months. All require a minimum deposit amount of $2,500. 30 days before your CD expires, you’re asked to redeem it or renew at the same rate and term. You have until nine days after its expiration to redeem, after which the CD is automatically renewed. Rates range from 0.35% on the 3-month vehicle to 2.25% on the 120-month product, with the popular 12-month account yielding 1.50%. Early withdrawal penalties are as follows:Three months’ interest for terms of less than 12 monthsSix months’ interest between 12 and 36 monthsNine months’ interest for 48 monthsEighteen months’ interest for 60 monthsTwenty-four months’ interest for 84 months and upIRAsDiscover Bank lets you open an IRA account (Roth or traditional)\\xa0with any of its CD products. There are no monthly maintenance fees. While these\\xa0accounts are advertised as tax-free, you may have to pay tax and penalties on withdrawals made before age 59 1/2. You can roll over several types of retirement accounts, including 401ks, 457 deferred compensation plans, annuities, and other traditional or Roth IRAs.Mortgage and Home Equity LoansThrough Discover Financial Services, Discover Bank offers access to mortgage, mortgage refinancing, and home equity loans. Its mortgage loans include a 30-year fixed rate, 15-year fixed rate, 15-year fixed rate FHA, and 5/1 adjustable rate vehicles. Refinance loans come in 30-year fixed, 15-year fixed, and 5/1 adjustable versions.Other LoansDiscover Bank also offers student loans for undergraduates, graduates, and post-graduates (such as medical residents and law school grads studying for the bar). The bank doesn’t charge origination or maintenance fees on these loan products, which come with rewards (a one-time\\xa0cash rebate equal to 1% of the value of a\\xa0newly issued student loan) for maintaining a GPA above 3.0 or its equivalent.To redeem this reward, you need to submit your transcript for the academic term covered by the loan within six months of its end date. Discover then reduces your loan’s principal by 1%.\\xa0An interest rate credit of 0.25% also applies to accounts with auto-debit. Additionally, Discover Bank issues personal loans for non-students, including debt consolidation loans\\xa0and loans for big-ticket purchases. Discover Bank doesn’t disclose interest rates for these loans on its website – you need to call for a personalized rate quote.Other FeaturesNo-Fee ATM Network. Discover works with the MoneyPass and Allpoint networks to provide fee-free ATM access at about 60,000 ATMs in the U.S. The bank’s online, mobile-friendly ATM locator marks these fee-free ATMs with orange pins.Google Wallet. Discover’s partnership with Google Wallet lets you store your Discover credit or debit card on your phone and pay for purchases without taking the card out of your wallet. Participating retailers include McDonald’s, Macy’s, CVS, Walgreens, Home Depot, Subway, and Petco.Mobile Check Deposit. Discover Bank has a pretty extensive mobile banking app that lets you deposit physical checks without visiting a branch or using the postal mail. Just enter the amount of your check, take photos of the front and back, and confirm your deposit.Gift Cards. Using the funds from your Discover savings or money market accounts (or any third-party bank account), you can purchase personalized, Discover-branded gift cards for $3.95 each. Denominations range from $20 to $500.Customer SupportDiscover Bank has a 24/7 customer support hotline and a slew of specific departments open during regular or extended business hours. Wait times longer than 10 minutes are rare, even during busy periods.You might not even have to talk to a human: Discover Bank has a pretty sophisticated help center with a detailed knowledge base and FAQ section.Advantages1. Direct Access to Consumer and Business Credit CardsDiscover Bank offers direct access to four\\xa0credit cards for individuals and businesses. All come with useful perks.Discover it Card. Like the Chase Freedom card, Discover it offers\\xa05% cash back on your first $1,500 spent in purchase categories, such as home improvement stores and movie theaters, which rotate quarterly. You get 1% cash back on all other purchases, without limit. These rewards can be redeemed for cash in the form of a check or bank account deposit, or for a gift card purchase.Discover it Card for Students. This one pays 2% cash back on up to $1,000 per quarter in purchases from gas stations and restaurants, and an unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases.Discover it Miles. This card earns unlimited 1.5 miles per $1 spent on qualifying purchases, with no caps or restrictions. Your mile earnings are doubled during the first year, again with no caps or restrictions. Miles are worth $0.01 apiece at redemption against travel purchases and other items.As a Discover credit card holder, you can also use the Discover Deals feature to earn\\xa0between 5% and 20% cash back on purchases made through its online portal. This functions like theChase Ultimate Rewards\\xa0and Upromise shopping portals: You choose from a list of about 200 online retailers on Discover’s website, click through to their respective sites, and make purchases with your Discover credit card. Cash back rewards then accrue to your account.You Might Also Like: Not sure these Discover credit cards are right for you? There are dozens more where they came from. Check out our roundup of the best cash back credit cards, or scroll through our entire credit card review library, for more ideas.2. Convenient\\xa0Payment With Google WalletDiscover Bank partners with mobile payments provider Google Wallet, allowing you to make debit or credit payments at major retailers without actually swiping your card. Other major credit card issuers, such as Visa and MasterCard, also offer this service, as do brick-and-mortar banks like Citibank. However, online banks such as Ally Bank, EverBank, and Capital One 360, do not.3. Full Line of Loan ProductsAlthough many national brick-and-mortar banks offer lending services for homebuyers, refinancing homeowners, and folks who just need some extra cash, online banks often have limited or nonexistent lending services. For instance, Ally Bank only makes auto loans to its clients, and EverBank only deals with folks who want to buy or refinance their homes.By contrast, Discover Bank makes mortgage loans, refinancing loans, home equity loans, a full lineup of student loans, and personal loans for debt consolidation and big-ticket purchases.4. 24-Hour Customer ServiceDiscover Bank features an online secure message feature\\xa0and a traditional phone center. The former is open at all times except midnight to 7am eastern time on Sundays, but the customer service center is always open to take phone calls. While some online banks (such as Ally Bank) also offer 24-hour phone support, many – including EverBank – do not.5. No Fees for ChecksEven if they offer to cover the cost of your first book of personal checks, many online banks charge for the privilege of cutting\\xa0a cashiers’ check or sending additional\\xa0books of personal checks. For instance, EverBank charges $10 per bank\\xa0check and Capital One 360 charges $5 for every additional book of 50 checks that you order. Many brick-and-mortar banks charge similar fees: Bank checks cost $10 a piece at Wells Fargo, and Flagstar Bank charges $20 plus tax for 100 new checks.By contrast, bank checks cut from Discover Bank’s money market accounts, savings accounts, and even CDs never cost anything. Discover also never charges for issuing checks to your account.Disadvantages1. High Minimum Deposits for Money Market and CD AccountsDiscover Bank\\xa0imposes minimum deposit requirements for its money market accounts ($2,500) and CDs ($2,500). Ally Bank and Capital One 360 both lack minimums on their money market accounts. EverBank requires lower deposits – $1,500 for its money market and savings accounts. For traditional banks, opening deposit requirements are usually minimal – for instance, Wells Fargo’s money market account asks just $50 to open.2.\\xa0No Early Withdrawals for CDs In addition to the high minimum opening deposit, Discover Bank’s CDs have another big limitation: You can’t cash them out early without incurring a penalty. This isn’t unusual, but no-penalty CDs have become more common in recent years. For instance, Ally Bank’s No Penalty CD offers an 11-month term with a 0.87% interest rate. PNC Bank’s Ready Access CD has a 12-month term and a 0.85% yield. Discover Bank’s closest analogue, the 12-month CD, comes with an interest rate of 1.15% and an early withdrawal penalty of three months’ interest.3. No BrokerageDiscover Bank might offer more loans than many of its online bank competitors, but it’s not attached to a brokerage that could provide additional investment options for account holders.Other online banks are much better in this department.\\xa0For instance, Capital One 360 lets you link a checking, savings, or money market account to its Capital One Investing platform and trade stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, and options with your deposited funds. While Discover Bank does offer retirement accounts, they’re limited to CDs.4. Past Legal Issues Though Discover Bank generally enjoys\\xa0high customer satisfaction ratings,\\xa0it has seen its share of controversy in the past. In 2005, the Supreme Court of California issued a ruling against the bank which invalidated a class action waiver contained within its arbitration clause. Basically, the waiver prevented regular customers with relatively small monetary claims\\xa0from joining class action suits against the bank. As a result of the verdict, Discover was forced to remove the class action waiver from its customer contract. If you’re looking for a bank with an unblemished record of customer service, look elsewhere.5. No Business Accounts or LoansAlthough Discover Bank does offer credit cards for small business owners, it\\xa0doesn’t have any business banking\\xa0accounts. Contrast this with EverBank, which has separate checking options for small businesses, large businesses, and nonprofit organizations, as well as money market accounts and CDs for businesses of all types. Unlike its Jacksonville-based competitor, Discover Bank also can’t get you a business loan. While some other online banks focus solely on consumers, many traditional banks\\xa0offer commercial loans as well.Final WordDiscover Bank offers an almost-full suite of online banking services, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, retirement options, and CDs.\\xa0It also connects its customers with several popular credit cards, which offer\\xa0perks like cash-back rewards and online shopping discounts.

Such fees can range from a few dollars to $20 or more, depending on the bank and other associated perks. To avoid these fees, you may need to maintain a high minimum daily balance, make regular\\xa0deposits of a certain size or frequency, or execute a minimum number of transactions in a statement period.Fortunately, it’s still possible to find free checking accounts. You just have to know where to look. Many online banks offer legitimately free, FDIC-insured (up to $250,000 per account) accounts with few restrictions and plenty of sweeteners. Some even pay noticeable interest.If you’re looking for\\xa0a checking account that\\xa0won’t eat away at your deposits, take a closer look at these options available to customers throughout the United States.Best Free Checking Accounts1. EverBank Yield Pledge CheckingYield Always in Top 5% of U.S. Checking Accounts; Many ATM Fees WaivedEverBank is a full-service online bank with a very attractive checking option: the Yield Pledge Checking Account. The “pledge” is that the account’s yield will always be in the top 5% of all U.S. checking accounts, as measured by the Bankrate BRM Index (released monthly). So far, EverBank has held up this bargain.Other advantages include a robust mobile app and an overdraft line of credit that may be cheaper than a traditional overdraft fee. Drawbacks include a minimum balance requirement for reimbursement of out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees, as well as a relatively high opening deposit requirement.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0EverBank requires a minimum opening deposit of $1,500, but you don’t have to maintain a minimum daily balance once the account is open.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0For balances less than $100,000, EverBank pays an annual interest rate of 1.40% for your first six months, compared to a prevailing annual\\xa0rate between 0.30% and 0.61%. For the second six months, rates drop to around 0.90%. After 12 months, Yield Pledge Checking’s prevailing rates take effect.Yield:\\xa0EverBank promises that Yield Pledge Checking’s yield is always in the top 5% of U.S. checking accounts. This account\\xa0pays annual interest on a tiered scale: 0.30% for balances less than $9,999, 0.41% for balances between $10,000 and $24,999, 0.46% between $25,000 and $49,999, 0.56% between $50,000 and $99,999, and 0.61% for balances greater than $100,000.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0EverBank never charges a fee to withdraw money from an ATM in the U.S.\\xa0Additionally, if you keep at least $5,000 in your account, you are reimbursed for other banks’ ATM fees.Mobile Features:\\xa0ATM finder, bill pay, check deposit (with photo), and send money to friends (People Pay). The account is Android and iPhone compatible.Overdraft Options:\\xa0EverBank doesn’t charge a flat overdraft fee. To avoid fees completely, you can link another EverBank account (savings or money market) to your checking account. If you attempt a transaction without sufficient funds in your checking account, EverBank automatically pulls money from one of those accounts. Each overdraft transfer counts toward your monthly limit of six outgoing transfers from your savings or money market account – a limit that’s common to all online banks on this list. If you’d prefer not to open or link another EverBank account,\\xa0you can opt in to an overdraft line of credit, which essentially charges a variable interest rate on negative balances. This rate is\\xa0based on the prime rate plus 5.9%.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0Replacement debit card ($10), domestic wires ($25), and stop payment ($30).See our EverBank Review for more information.2. Bank5 Connect High-Interest Checking AccountVery Attractive Yields, Even on Low BalancesIf you’re looking for an attractive yield with a reasonable minimum balance requirement, it’s hard to do better than the Bank5 Connect High-Interest Checking Account. Bank5 Connect also has reasonable overdraft fees and a generous reimbursement policy for third-party ATM fees. A sub-par mobile app counts against it.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0There’s a $10 minimum opening balance and no daily minimum balance requirement. However, to earn interest you need to keep a daily balance of at least $100.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0None.Yield:\\xa0All Bank5 Connect High-Interest Checking Account balances greater than $100 yield 0.76%. This is significantly higher than many competitors.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0Bank5 Connect never charges a fee for withdrawing money at U.S. ATMs. If you withdraw from other banks’ ATMs, Bank5 Connect reimburses those surcharges up to a total of $15 per month. Your first order of personal checks (five books), all wire transfers, and cashiers checks are also free.Mobile Features:\\xa0Check deposit and bill pay. The account is Android and iPhone compatible, though the mobile app is not as user-friendly as other options.Overdraft Options:\\xa0If you have a savings account with Bank5 Connect, you can opt in to an overdraft transfer program that automatically pulls money from it to cover a checking account overdraft. If you don’t have another account with Bank5 Connect, you can opt in to overdraft protection, which levies a flat fee of $15 per overdraft.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0Returned deposit ($5.71), stop payment ($15), and levies and garnishments, which is when\\xa0a government entity pulls funds from your bank account to cover back taxes, judgments, or other legal obligations ($25 per item).3. Bank of Internet USA Rewards CheckingTiered Yields up to 1.25%Though the Bank of Internet USA Rewards Checking account doesn’t automatically pay interest, you can earn a yield of up to 1.25% on your funds by meeting certain qualifications. These include using your debit card 10 times per month and accepting a monthly direct deposit of at least $1,000.On the other hand, there’s no overdraft service unless you open another account with BoI. And, though the bank advertises free checks with a new checking account, you actually need to request them when you open the account (and checks might not be the first thing on your mind at that time).Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0You need $100 to open a Rewards Checking account, but there’s no minimum daily balance requirement once it’s open.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0None.Yield:\\xa0Rewards Checking accounts come with a base yield of 0%. However, you can earn interest on balances of any amount in several ways. If you only receive a $1,000 direct deposit or use your card at least 10 times (but less than 15) in a given month, your annual interest rate for that month is 0.4166%. If you use your card at least 15 times, it’s 0.8333%. If you both receive a\\xa0$1,000 deposit and use\\xa0your card at least 10 times, your rate for that month is also 0.8333%. If you receive a $1,000 deposit and use your card at least 15 times, you earn 1.25%.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0Bank of Internet USA offers unlimited reimbursements for all U.S. ATM fees. You also get your first 50 checks free with a Rewards Checking account if you ask for them at account opening.Mobile Features:\\xa0Check deposits, bill pay, send money to friends (Popmoney), and FinanceWorks (a budgeting tool from Quicken). The account is Android and iPhone compatible.Overdraft Options:\\xa0Bank of Internet USA offers free overdraft transfers from a linked internal savings or money market account. If you don’t opt in to this service, any transaction that would result in an overdraft fails.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0Debit card replacement ($10), cashiers checks ($10), and stop payment ($35).4. Ally Bank Interest CheckingNo Minimums; No ATM Fees, EverAlly Bank is one of the original online banks, and its Interest Checking account remains immensely popular. There are no minimums of any kind here. Ally also reimburses all third-party ATM fees, without exclusion. Low overdraft fees (just $9 per transaction) sweeten the deal further.Drawbacks include low yields on modest balances and a surcharge on all international transactions.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0There’s no minimum deposit to open an account, and no minimum daily balance.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0None.Yield:\\xa0This account yields 0.10% annually on balances less than $15,000, and 0.60% annually on balances greater than that amount.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0Ally Bank never charges ATM fees and provides unlimited reimbursements for all\\xa0third-party ATM fees or surcharges at the end of each month.Mobile Features:\\xa0Mobile check deposit (Ally eCheck Deposit), ATM finder, send money to a friend (Popmoney), bill pay, and internal and external transfers. The account is Android and iPhone compatible.Overdraft Options:\\xa0Ally lets you opt in to a free overdraft transfer service that pulls funds from your savings or money market account to cover negative balances. You can also opt in to an overdraft protection program that charges a one-time fee of $9 per overdraft transaction. If you don’t elect either program, you won’t be able to make transactions that would result in an overdraft.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0Stop payment ($15), outgoing wires ($20), and international transactions (1% of transaction total).See our Ally\\xa0Bank Review for more information.5. Capital One 360 CheckingNo Minimum Balances; $50 Account Opening Bonus360 Checking from Capital One 360 comes with an attractive yield, especially for larger balances. When you open a new account, it automatically pays you a bonus without requiring you to jump through hoops\\xa0– a rarity among banks, traditional or online.360 Checking’s mobile app is among the best in the business, with intuitive mobile check deposit, an interactive ATM finder, seamless person-to-person money transfers, and text alerts for a wide range of account functions. Drawbacks include high fees for replacement debit cards, high minimum balance requirements for the best annual yields, and no out-of-network ATM fee reimbursements.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0There’s no minimum deposit or balance required for this account.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0The 360 Checking Account comes with an opening bonus of $50, regardless of the opening deposit amount. However, Capital One reserves the right to discontinue it\\xa0at any time.Yield:\\xa0Capital One 360 Checking yields 0.20% annually on balances up to $49,999, 0.75% on balances between $50,000 and $99,999, and 0.80% greater than $100,000.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0In addition to the $50 account opening bonus, you get access to about 40,000 fee-free ATMs nationwide – 38,000 in the Allpoint network, and 2,000 Capital One-branded machines. All new accounts come with a free checkbook as well.\\xa0Out of this network, your ATM fees aren’t reimbursed.Mobile Features:\\xa0Check deposit (using the CheckMate app), ATM finder, send money to friends (using Person2Person), bill pay, and text alerts for balances and bills due. The account is Android and iPhone compatible.Overdraft Options:\\xa0You can opt in to an overdraft line of credit that accrues daily interest. Capital One 360 doesn’t say how this rate is calculated, but it sits near 11.5%\\xa0annually.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0Replacement debit card ($25), NSF or non-sufficient funds\\xa0check ($9), and stop payment ($25).See our Capital One 360 Review for more information.6. eOne Checking by Salem Five DirectNo Minimum Opening Deposit or Balance RequirementsThis account from Salem Five Direct offers a decent yield across the board, and does not require a minimum opening deposit or daily balance. It also reimburses all third-party ATM fees without limit – a powerful sweetener for a bank that has few branded ATMs of its own. However, the annual yield is a bit low, and the mobile platform isn’t user-friendly.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0There are no minimum opening deposit or balance requirements.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0None.Yield:\\xa0All balances held in Salem Five Direct’s eOne Checking account yield 0.25% annually.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0Salem Five Direct reimburses all ATM fees charged by other financial institutions. Your first order of checks (five books) is also free.Mobile Features:\\xa0Bill pay and mobile check deposit. The account is Android and iPhone compatible, though the platform feels outdated.Overdraft Options:\\xa0You can opt in to an overdraft protection program that charges a one-time fee of $25 per overdraft transaction. Under this program, Salem Five Direct doesn’t charge for overdrafts of less than $5. However, if you don’t opt in, any transaction that would result in an overdraft fails.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0Stop payment ($30), paper statements ($2.95 per statement), and returned deposits ($5.71).7. TIAA Direct Interest CheckingDirect Deposit Bonus of Up to $100TIAA Direct is an online bank that’s\\xa0affiliated with TIAA-CREF, a large financial\\xa0company that markets insurance and investment products to employees of nonprofits. However, TIAA Direct’s banking products, including its Interest Checking account, are open to all residents of the United States – not just nonprofit employees. It boasts a juicy account opening bonus – up to $100 – that’s relatively easy to obtain.Its yield isn’t as impressive as EverBank’s or Bank5 Connect’s, but little perks such as free replacement debit cards sweeten the deal. The fact that it has no out-of-network reimbursements and hefty daily overdraft fees are significant drawbacks.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0TIAA Direct requires a $25 opening deposit, but you don’t have to maintain a minimum balance once the account is open.Account Bonus:\\xa0You need to call TIAA to take advantage of this offer. For both new\\xa0and\\xa0existing accounts, the bank\\xa0pays a cash bonus of $50\\xa0when you set up and receive a direct deposit of at least $250 within 60 days of calling TIAA. If you receive at least two additional direct deposits of at least $250 within 120 days of calling TIAA, the bank pays an additional $50 bonus, for a total cash bonus of $100.Yield:\\xa0This account’s annual yield is 0.05% for balances less than $1,500, 0.10% for balances between $1,500 and $24,999, and 0.15% for balances greater than $25,000.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0TIAA Direct has a network of 23,000 fee-free ATMs (MoneyPass and SUM-branded). Out of this network, the bank doesn’t reimburse ATM fees. Your first book of checks and reordered debit cards are free.Mobile Features:\\xa0ATM locator, bill pay, real-time transfers (external and internal), and balance updates. The account is Android and iPhone compatible.Overdraft Options:\\xa0TIAA Direct offers two opt-in overdraft plans. The first is a free overdraft transfer program that automatically transfers funds from a linked TIAA savings or money market account to an overdrawn checking account. The second levies a $25 charge for each checking account transaction (using your debit card) that results in an overdraft, up to a maximum of $75 per day. This second option may be the only one\\xa0available if you don’t have a linked account.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0NSF or non-sufficient funds checks ($25 for each, $75 single-day maximum), cashiers checks ($5), paper statements ($5), and stop payment ($25).8. Independent Bank Free Rewards CheckingPotential for Very High Checking YieldsIndependent Bank\\xa0is a Texas-based institution that offers banking products to customers across the U.S. Though its Free Rewards Checking account comes with a relatively low baseline interest rate, it has the potential to yield up to 1.50% annually when used properly. If you satisfy certain conditions, the Free Rewards Checking account pays better than many 24-month CDs. These conditions are that you make\\xa0at least 12 debit card purchases per month, sign up for electronic statements, and have at least one monthly direct deposit or debit.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0You need to make a minimum opening deposit of $100, but there’s no minimum balance requirement thereafter.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0None.Yield:\\xa0This account has a baseline annual yield of 0.05% on all balances. However, you can dramatically boost your account’s annual yield – to 1.50% on balances up to $15,000 – by meeting three qualifications: signing up for electronic statements, initiating at least one direct deposit or debit per month, and making at least 12 debit card transactions per month. If you meet the qualifications,\\xa0only balances below $15,000 are eligible to yield 1.50% annually.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0Independent Bank never charges a fee to use ATMs. It also offers unlimited reimbursements for all ATM fees levied by other institutions. If you open a REALSaver account (yielding 0.50% annually), sign up for electronic statements, initiate a monthly direct deposit, and make at least 12 monthly debit card transactions, Independent Bank automatically deposits your ATM reimbursements into that account.Mobile Features:\\xa0Bill pay, ATM finder, check deposit, and text alerts. The account is Android and iPhone compatible.Overdraft Options:\\xa0Independent Bank allows you to tie in a checking or money market account and make fee-free transfers to cover your checking account’s overdraft transactions. You can also opt in to an overdraft protection program that charges a one-time fee of $27 per overdraft transaction. If you don’t opt in to either program, you can’t make transactions that would result in a negative balance.Possible\\xa0Fees.\\xa0Stop payment ($25), NSF or non-sufficient funds checks ($27), and outgoing wire transfers ($20).9. UFB Direct Airline Rewards CheckingOne Airline Mile for Every $2 Spent\\xa0UFB Direct is affiliated with Bank of Internet USA, but administers a separate checking account that focuses on cash back and airline rewards. For every $2 you spend with your debit card, you earn one American AAdvantage mile. Though exact redemption values vary based on route popularity and other factors, 12,500 is often enough to cover the cost of a round trip between any North American destinations.A free overdraft transfer program is nice too.\\xa0The biggest downside is the lack of an annual yield.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0There’s a minimum opening deposit of $100, but no minimum balance thereafter.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0None.Yield:\\xa0This account doesn’t pay interest.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0UFB Direct’s biggest draw is an airline rewards program that earns a baseline of one American AAdvantage mile for every $2 spent by debit card, and an additional one-time bonus of 1,000 miles for scheduling a monthly direct deposit totaling at least $1,000. To be eligible, you need to sign up for an American AAdvantage rewards account before opening your UFB Direct Airline Rewards Checking account.

When you\\xa0link another UFB Direct account, the bank automatically pulls funds to cover overdrafts from your Airline Rewards Checking account.\\xa0If you don’t link an account and you try to make a transaction that would result in an overdraft, the transaction fails.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0Debit card replacement ($10), stop payment ($35), and cashiers checks ($10).10. FNBO Direct Online Checking AccountCompetitive Yields on All Checking Account BalancesThe FNBO Direct Online Checking account is a straightforward product that pays an attractive yield on all balances, has a negligible minimum opening deposit, and never requires\\xa0a minimum balance. Despite its no-frills appearance, this account has a nice mobile platform that lets you send money directly to friends and family at no charge.FNBO does have some drawbacks: It doesn’t reimburse out-of-network ATM fees, and charges hefty daily overdraft fees.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0There’s a minimum opening deposit amount of $1 and no minimum balance requirement.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0None.Yield:\\xa0This account yields 0.65% annually on all balances.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0FNBO Direct doesn’t charge its own ATM withdrawal fees.

If you don’t opt in, you can’t make transactions that would result in an overdraft.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0Outgoing wires ($15) and cashiers checks ($10).See our FNBO Direct Review for more information.11. First Internet Bank of Indiana Free CheckingLow Minimum Opening Deposit; No Minimum Balance RequirementDespite its parochial name, a\\xa0First Internet Bank of Indiana\\xa0account is available to anyone with a U.S. address.\\xa0It doesn’t have a minimum balance requirement and has a negligible minimum opening deposit.Its biggest drawbacks include no yield, a fee of about $5 per month for bill pay, and no reimbursement for other banks’ ATM fees.Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements:\\xa0You can open an account with a $25 deposit. There’s no minimum balance requirement after that.Account Opening Bonus:\\xa0None.Yield:\\xa0This account doesn’t pay interest.Rewards and Incentives:\\xa0First Internet Bank of Indiana doesn’t charge its own ATM fees. However, it\\xa0never\\xa0reimburses those of other banks, which is problematic because its own ATM network is small.\\xa0You get 50 checks free with your account opening.Mobile Features:\\xa0Enrollment in FinanceWorks and bill pay (optional, costs $4.95 per month). The account is Android and iPhone compatible.Overdraft Options:\\xa0You can opt in to an overdraft protection plan that charges a one-time fee of $30 for each overdraft transaction. Otherwise, transactions that would result in an overdraft fail.Possible\\xa0Fees:\\xa0Optional bill pay ($4.95 per month), paper statements ($3), replacement debit card ($5), and cashiers checks ($5).Final WordIf you cling to the quaint notion that you shouldn’t have to pay for a basic checking account, any one of these options should suit you. However, before you settle on a choice, do your homework. Be especially vigilant for any signs of systemic problems, such as data security issues or a pattern of customer service complaints, at your chosen bank.\\xa0After all, you don’t want to stop being an educated consumer just because a product or service is free.What’s your favorite free checking account?Related40.8K Views34 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInRelated ArticlesTips to Open A Checking Account Chase Business Checking Account Review - $200 Bonus How to Choose a Bank That's Right for You Chase College Checking Account Review - Good Banking Option for Students? 9 Reasons to Break Up With Your Bank - When Changing Makes Sense FNBO Direct Review - No Frills, Online High-Yield Checking Account FacebookTweetPinLinkedInGoogle+StumbleUponPrintEmailCategories: BankingBrian MartucciBrian Martucci is a blogger-journalist who writes about frugal living, entrepreneurship, and innovative ideas.

Preparation for Christmas often begins in early autumn, while many people wait until the last minute to complete and file tax returns.Despite the fact that three out of every four filers receive a refund, nobody likes income tax time. However, there are ways to make the experience less hectic and easier to endure.How to More Easily File Your Income Tax FormWhether you file your own taxes or use a professional preparer, the key to a satisfactory, tension-free result is organization. Trying to make sense of a rat’s nest of paper receipts, canceled checks, brokerage statements, and other miscellaneous bits of information is frustrating and time-consuming. The confusion adds time for you, and unnecessary expense if you are using a professional tax preparer. It also increases the probability of mistakes in determining the correct tax liability. If you pay too little, you may be subject to a tax audit and additional penalties; paying too much effectively gives a donation to the government that could have been returned to you in a refund. Avoid such troubles by following these tips.1. Collect Pertinent Income and Expense InformationAround the end of January each year, employers, vendors, financial institutions, and others prepare and forward various forms and information pertinent to your filing. Create a set of files, whether a large multi-pocketed accordion file, a group of large manila envelopes, or a digital filing system on your hard drive to sort and separate the data into one of the following categories:Personal Information. This information should include the legal names of who is filing and who is covered by the return (spouse and dependents). You need Social Security numbers and dates of birth as well. I also keep my primary bank information – account number and bank routing number – so I can request a\\xa0direct deposit refund\\xa0if circumstances warrant.Income. Common forms include W-2s from employers, 1099 forms for other forms of income such as self-employment, investments, and retirement distributions, and K-1s for any partnerships in which you participate. Keep a special folder for\\xa0security transactions\\xa0so you can easily determine holding periods from buy and sell dates to ensure that you qualify for capital gains treatment wherever possible.Personal Expenses (Deductions). While you will receive Form 5498 for IRA and health savings accounts contributions from vendors, and Form 1098 for home mortgage interest deductions, most of the information documenting allowable deductions such as business expenses, entertainment, or travel must be elicited from other financial documents such as check registers, cancelled checks, bank statements, and credit card statements. Download and print summaries of the prior year’s transactions for each credit card, and review each transaction to determine whether it may be deductible. I use a marker to highlight the transactions that may affect my filing for easy identification later. A similar culling process can be used with canceled checks.Business Information. If you own a small business, perform freelancing jobs, or have other side income, you need to keep the business income and expense items separate from your personal information. There are some expenses that are\\xa0deductible for a business, but not a personal filer. If you have questions about what type of information to save, review Schedule C of the 1040.2. Review Tax Filings from Previous YearsFor most people, the changes from one tax year to the next are relatively slight. Previous tax returns are great reminders of areas that can easily be overlooked, such as interest or dividends, capital loss carry-forward balances, and infrequently used deductions.I keep paper copies as well as scanned copies of past year returns, in addition to four spreadsheets detailing the income and expenses for each year. One spreadsheet contains the information from\\xa0Form 1040, while the others have previously filed data for Schedules A, C, and D. This format allows me to easily check whether I’ve overlooked an income or expense item, as well as the changes in the amounts that occur year to year. For example, if I had received dividends from one security holding or interest from a particular bank in prior years but the amount is missing or substantially changed for the current year, I know to check for the reason behind the omission, increase, or decrease before completing my tax filing.3. Fund IRAs and SEPs to Allowable LimitsIf you are participating in an employer-sponsored individual 401k plan, 403b retirement plan, or other qualified retirement plan, the deadline for contributions is December 31st. However, the opportunity to\\xa0fund an IRA\\xa0completely is available until April 15th. If you are younger than 50 years of age and have contributed less than $5,500 for the current year, or are older than 50 and have contributed less than $6,500, you can still invest money on a tax-sheltered basis for last year.If some or all of your income is generated via self-employment, you can set up a simplified employee pension (SEP) IRA until the due date of your tax return (including extensions),\\xa0and contribute up to 25% of your self-employment income. If you have the opportunity to choose between paying income taxes or funding your retirement, it should be an easy decision. While Roth IRA contributions are not deductible, IRA and SEP contributions are fully deductible depending upon your income, filing status, and participation in an employer plan. Income within a retirement plan – whether IRA, SEP, or Roth IRA – is not taxed until withdrawn.4. Automate or Outsource Tax Calculation and FilingWhile the IRS has made a significant effort to simplify tax forms and thus reduce the time and complexity of filing a tax return, it remains a daunting task, especially since it occurs only once per year and often is accompanied by a great deal of stress. Fortunately, a number of companies offer very sophisticated software programs to help filers complete the task quickly and relatively inexpensively.Unless you are a masochist or enjoy spending hours with the tax code, a calculator, and a myriad of different tax forms, you should use one of the\\xa0popular software programs\\xa0from TurboTax, TaxACT, H&R Block, or other providers. The IRS even offers free tax filing software\\xa0for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $58,000 or less. To determine whether you are eligible for the free software, just check last year’s return for your adjusted gross income (AGI) which appears on line 37 of Form 1040.For those with incomes greater than $58,000, the IRS provides Free File fillable forms for electronic filing. However, the forms offer only basic guidance, so you must know how to do your taxes yourself. Most of the filing programs allow you to keep track of any refund due and select the method of payment you desire (direct deposit, paper check, or hold and apply for the coming year).The decision to use a professional preparer, rather than a software program, should be based upon your income, the complexity of your return, unusual events that significantly affect your income or expenses, and your concern about a tax audit. In my experience, the difference between the better software programs and the typical preparer at a walk-in tax preparation office is minuscule. The typical software is very sophisticated and leads the filer through a series of detailed questions to verify amounts and the appropriate tax treatments; the typical store-front preparer is a seasonal, part-time employee whose training in tax preparation may be limited to a few hours of company-offered instruction. In either case, the quality of their work depends upon the information provided to them as a result of your diligence and earlier preparation.Tax filers who\\xa0should consult an experienced tax professional before filing taxes this year include\\xa0those who:Have a gross income greater than $150,000Participate in complex investments that have tax preference or are managed through partnerships or private businessesExperienced a significant change in either income or expense during the previous year, or a life-changing event such as the death of a spouse or partner, a divorce, marriage, bankruptcy, change in the number or status of dependents (such as caring for aged parents or a child moving back home), or retirementStarted or closed a full- or part-time business, purchased or sold a home, rented a home or room, or received or paid significant fines or penalties related to a lawsuit during the tax yearAre concerned that tax filing will trigger IRS scrutiny and a possible auditHave concerns that calculations cannot be completed accurately and entirelyIf you meet any of those descriptions, the cost of advice from a certified public accountant or tax attorney will be worth the peace of mind. It is fully tax-deductible (so long as the fees are in “connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax”), and may result in a lower tax liability. Readers should note that personal legal expenses for other purposes are considered “miscellaneous itemized deductions,” and are deductible in excess of 2% of AGI.5. Do (a Little) ResearchSince tax laws and interpretations are continually changing, every filer should attempt to be as informed as possible. Even if you are using a tax advisor, it is prudent to understand the tax issues and treatments that affect you as completely as possible in order to make the best decisions.Spending an hour or two online researching specific taxable situations or conditions that are relevant to you is easy. For example, entering the term “freelance income” in a search engine reveals numerous sources about the tax treatment and filing of freelance income. A search of the term “home rental income” delivers a similar number of sources about\\xa0the treatment of home rental income. You can never know too much about income taxes – after all, it is your money that you keep by minimizing your tax liability.6. File EarlyThere are three good reasons to complete your filing as early as possible:Information Is Readily Available. Employers, vendors, and financial institutions are legally obligated to mail the required W-2s and 1099Rs by January 31st. Completing your taxes as soon as you have information prevents confusion, tension, and the loss of data.Filing Is Inevitable. It is a duty that is required every year – why procrastinate? Getting it behind you gives you time to focus on other things.You Can Invest Your Refund as Soon as Possible. It is your money and it is not earning interest in the government’s till. File your return and save the refund.The one reason to delay filing until April 15th is because you owe taxes. If you have tax liabilities, the best approach is to complete the calculations and fill out all of the required forms, but delay the actual filing until April 15th. There is no penalty or interest charged if you file and remit any unpaid balance at that time.7. Prepare for Next Year’s Tax FilingWhile it is too late to affect the tax bill for this year, it is not too early to begin planning and making changes that might reduce your liability for the upcoming year. If you have a significant amount of unpaid taxes at the end of the year, an unusually large refund due, or you anticipate a significant change in income during the current year, consider reducing your withholding allowance so that more is collected from your paychecks during the year or, conversely, increasing the withholding allowance to have more money distributed to you each pay period. Of course, some people prefer to get a larger refund check, rather than a small increase in take-home income every pay period, because it is less tempting to spend and more likely to be saved.If your employer offers flexible spending accounts for healthcare, childcare, or commuting expenses, take advantage of them early in the year. This allows you to pay those expenses with pre-tax dollars, rather than after-tax dollars.Maintain your filing system for the current year, storing receipts and other information year-round which will be useful in filing income taxes next year. And remain diligent about keeping up with any news about investments or changes that might affect you tax-wise.\\xa0Being forewarned is forearmed.Final WordPreparing for and paying taxes doesn’t have to be a hassle – it is the consequence we bring upon ourselves by procrastination and disorganization. Follow these tips and you will be able to spend the evening of April 15th at home in front of the television set after a nice meal instead of waiting in the automobile traffic in front of the post office.Do you have any additional suggestions to make tax filing easier?Related1.6K SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInRelated ArticlesHow to File Your Tax Return - 2017 Basics & Guide What Is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) - Requirements & Eligibility Top 7 Options for Free Online Tax Preparation Software & Services 4 Different Types of Taxes and How To Minimize Them Filing Taxes After Divorce - Tax Implications & Claiming Children How to File for an IRS Tax Extension Electronically or With Form 4868 FacebookTweetPinLinkedInGoogle+StumbleUponPrintEmailCategories: Money Management, TaxesMichael LewisMichael R.

No matter what your business does, a credit card can\\xa0probably help – as long as you use credit wisely and avoid making purchases your company can’t afford.Small business credit cards typically have higher spending limits and more generous rewards programs than consumer cards. Some have additional benefits, such as low APRs, attractive balance transfer promotions, personalized concierge service, and fringe benefits. However, many also come with annual fees and require good or excellent credit to qualify.Best Small Business Credit CardsThe following small business credit cards offer a favorable mix of advantages and drawbacks for business owners with strong credit.1.

Apply NowFinal WordThe sharing economy is changing what it means to be in business for yourself. Being an entrepreneur\\xa0today can be\\xa0as simple as driving for a ridesharing app in your\\xa0spare time, renting out an extra bedroom for short stays on Airbnb, or putting up a\\xa0personal\\xa0website touting your freelance skills. You don’t need thousands of dollars in startup capital, a dedicated office, or employees working under you.If you’re a lean, modern “solopreneur,” you might not realize that you’re eligible to apply for business credit cards – but you probably are. And even if you aren’t in business for yourself at the moment, starting your own small business is likely to be simpler than you think. When the time comes to set out on your own, make sure you have a trusty spending ally in your wallet.Keep in mind that qualifying for business credit cards is a bit different from qualifying for consumer credit cards. Some issuers simply require you to submit a valid Social Security number and affirm in writing that you’ll use the card exclusively for business purposes.\\xa0Such laid-back issuers welcome freelancers and solopreneurs – basically, anyone who files a Schedule C at tax time, including people who don’t really think of themselves as business owners.Some issuers are more strict. They request a federal employer identification number (EIN), seek evidence of incorporation, or ask\\xa0for\\xa0financial statements. If you can’t prove that you actually own an incorporated business with legitimate cash flow, you won’t qualify.Also, remember that business credit cards are exempt from some of the protections of the CARD Act, including the requirement that card issuers regularly notify cardholders of changes in terms and conditions.What’s your favorite\\xa0credit card for business spending?Related246K Views43 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInEditorial Note: The editorial content on this page is not provided by any bank, credit card issuer, airline, or hotel chain, and has not been reviewed, approved, or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities.

It’s been in continuous operation for more than 20 years – an impressive run for an all-digital trading platform.Like other online brokerages, Capital One Investing is a Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) member. SIPC is a public corporation that compensates investors for losses of cash and securities in the event that their brokerage declares bankruptcy. It provides $250,000 in insurance for cash balances held in your brokerage account, and $500,000 in insurance for securities, with a total insurance cap of $500,000 in combined cash and securities.History of Capital One InvestingSeattle-based Capital One Investing, originally known as NetStock Direct, was founded in 1996. From the beginning, the service was envisioned as an efficient intermediary through which retail investors and investment professionals could buy and sell securities without using a human broker to place the trade.\\xa0Customers are entirely self-directed, performing their own research and executing their own trades.In late 2007, ING Direct, an online banking subsidiary of the ING Group, bought the company – then known as ShareBuilder – for more than $200 million. When Capital One Financial Corporation purchased ING Direct in 2012, ShareBuilder was included as part of the deal. It now serves as Capital One 360’s online investing platform, complementing the full range of banking and lending services offered by Capital One 360.You Might Also Like: Many Americans know Capital One as a credit card issuer. They’re not wrong. The company has a lively credit card stable that includes two of my favorites: Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card and Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. They routinely make our lists of the best cash back credit cards and best travel rewards credit cards, respectively.Key FeaturesNew Account BonusesLike many online brokerages, Capital One Investing offers account bonuses for investors who open new brokerage or retirement accounts with the company.Capital One Investing’s bonuses increase on a graduated scale:$50 for at least $5,000 in new money deposited, transferred, or rolled over from an external account$100 for at least $15,000$200 for at least $50,000$300 for at least $100,000$600 for at least $200,000Note that there’s no minimum to open an account with Capital One Investing, but you’re not entitled to a bonus unless you deposit at least $5,000 to start. Bonuses aren’t available for withdrawal for 180 days after they’re awarded, and qualifying assets used to calculate your bonus must remain in the account for nine months.Available Investment Products & PricingCapital One Investing has a wide variety of investment products:Stocks: You can trade exchange-listed and over-the-counter U.S.-listed stocks on Capital One Investing’s platform.ETFs: ETFs are baskets of equities or other securities listed on exchanges. They’re more liquid (and thus easier to trade) than mutual funds. Like mutual funds, they typically carry expense ratios ranging from less than 0.1% to more than 1% annually.Mutual Funds: Capital One Investing offers access to hundreds of of mutual funds from major issuers like Vanguard. Low-expense index and bond funds feature prominently here, as do actively managed funds. Many funds have no transaction fees, though expense ratios may cut into your returns.Options: You can write covered calls and trade calls and puts in select equities through Capital One Investing’s options trading portal. Check out the platform’s options page for more information and remember that options aren’t suitable for all investors.The standard commission is $6.95 per online trade for stocks, ETFs, and options. Options trades carry an additional $0.75 per contract charge. Mutual fund commissions vary widely, but many have no transaction fees at all – check each fund’s prospectus for specific information. Broker-assisted phone trades cost $19.95 each. Dividend reinvestment (opt-in) is free for most securities.Note: These investment products are all available to self-directed investors. Higher net worth investors using Capital One Advisors Managed Portfolios (see below) may be offered access to other types of investment products. Check with your advisor for more details.General Investing AccountsCapital One Investing’s general investing account types include:Individual Brokerage Account: This is a traditional, non-tax-advantaged brokerage account held in your name. If you’re choosing to self-direct your investments, you have sole control over the account and all decisions related to its management.Joint Brokerage Account: Joint brokerage accounts are ideal for couples who’ve chosen to\\xa0merge finances after marriage. The account comes with joint rights of survivorship, meaning sole custody transfers to the surviving account holder without going through probate.Retirement AccountsCapital One Investing’s retirement account options include:Traditional IRA: Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible in the current tax year, up to an annual maximum of $5,500 for younger investors and $6,500 for those aged 50 and over. Check with the IRS or a licensed financial professional for specific rules around the timing and size of withdrawals, as too-large or -early withdrawals can incur significant financial penalties.Roth IRA: Roth IRAs are tax-advantaged upon withdrawal, provided the withdrawals (or distributions) meet certain conditions. Generally, withdrawals of funds held in the account longer than five years are tax-free after age 70.5. Check with the IRS or a licensed financial professional for specifics.Small Business 401(k): Capital One’s Spark vertical offers the Spark 401(k), a small business retirement account option that includes up to 20 fund options and five model portfolios. If you’re not sure where to start, speak with a Capital One financial advisor for more details – you won’t automatically be locked into a managed portfolio relationship. Check current IRS regulations for contribution limits and other plan restrictions.Capital One Investing accepts qualifying employer plan rollovers and existing-account transfers from other brokerages. The rollover process is pretty straightforward, even for non-experts. Check Capital One Investing’s rollover and transfer page for more details.Custodial & Education AccountsCapital One Investing offers custodial and educational accounts for minor children, youths, and their parents:Custodial Account: You can set up a custodial account for your child or minor ward under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act. As the custodial account holder, you have full discretion over the account until the minor account holder reaches the age of majority. Custodial accounts aren’t tax-advantaged like retirement accounts, but their gains and income may be subject to taxation at different rates than adult individual brokerage accounts. Regardless, they’re great for teaching kids about money.Education Savings Account: You an open an ESA (commonly known as a Coverdell ESA) to help a young beneficiary save for college tuition and other qualifying higher education expenses. ESA earnings are tax-advantaged, but there’s a relatively strict annual contribution limit: $2,000.PortfolioBuilderCapital One Investing’s PortfolioBuilder is a tool for self-directed investors who need a little extra help putting their portfolios together – and who don’t mind paying a bit extra for it.PortfolioBuilder lets you select and bundle six to eight name-brand ETFs into a single bulk-bought tranche. Each PortfolioBuilder portfolio costs $18.95 to assemble and another $18.95 to sell.PortfolioBuilder doesn’t include rebalancing or automatic investing. If you want to add to or rebalance your holdings, you need to execute those transactions manually, at the standard $6.95-per-trade commission.Capital One Advisors Managed Portfolio AccountsIf you don’t have the time or inclination to manage your own portfolio, talk to a Capital One Advisors team member about building one on your behalf. Though this is a more expensive option than robo-advisor services from the likes of Wealthfront and Betterment, it comes with a human touch that the machines can’t (yet) match.Capital One Advisors Managed Portfolios are diversified baskets of ETFs – similar to PortfolioBuilder portfolios, but more personalized to your risk tolerance and investing goals. All trades, including rebalancing, are handled by software-assisted human advisors.This vertical’s minimum portfolio size is $25,000, so it’s not for investors just starting out. The annual management fee is a flat 0.9% of assets under management, plus commissions and expenses. Note that you can’t just turn up a Managed Portfolio overnight – you’ll need to speak with an advisor and answer some questions about your objectives and risk tolerance, then evaluate and approve your investment plan before putting your money to work.Research ToolsCapital One Investing has a slew of research tools for self-directed investors:Investment Screener: This feature subjects equities and funds to a slew of subjective and quantitative criteria to determine their overall suitability and potential performance. Criteria include sector, market cap, price, dividend yield, and options availability.Fund Evaluator: This is a fund-specific tool that shows historical performance, expense ratio, Morningstar rating, and other helpful data points, plus head-to-head and multi-point comparisons with other funds identified as comparable (and potentially more suitable) by Capital One Investing.Heat Map: This is a snapshot-in-time displaying individual securities’ performance over short, medium, and long timeframes. It’s useful for active traders looking to take the market’s pulse on any given day.What If I Had Invested: This is a retrospective calculator with a self-explanatory name. Plug in securities on your watchlist to see what you might have missed (or what bullets you might have dodged). Just remember: Historical analysis is useful, but past performance doesn’t predict future results.Investment Comparison Tool: This tool lets you compare up to five securities at once: performance, fundamentals, yield, and more.Watch List: Use this tool to keep track of stocks and funds you’re watching, with financial details and other pertinent information available at a glance.Market Movers: This is a roundup of they day’s major gainers and losers. Like Heat Map, it’s a useful tool for active investors – not to much for passive investors prone to nausea at the slightest hint of market volatility.Tracking Alerts: These alerts, available by email and SMS, keep you on top of your watch list equities (and other securities you’re watching) without having to log into your Capital One Investing account or even pull up the app on your phone.Retire My Way: This is an interactive retirement calculator that shows roughly how much income you can expect to have when you retire – and what you can do to change that, hopefully for the better. It’s a DIY alternative for investors leery of paying 0.9% AUM each year for a managed portfolio with Capital One Advisors.ShareBuilder PlanThe ShareBuilder Plan (or ShareBuilder Investment Plan) is an automatic investing feature that lets you schedule automatic investments in more than 7,000 stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds for a cut-rate commission of $3.95 per trade – a savings of 40% on the regular per-trade commission of $6.95.After selecting your preferred security (or securities), determine the dollar amount that you’d like to invest, choose a market or limit price order, and specify whether you’d like to invest on a weekly, monthly, or one-time basis. All automatic ShareBuilder trades are executed on Tuesdays. If you don’t have sufficient funds to complete an order at the specified time, you won’t incur a penalty – the order just won’t be executed.Express Funding OptionCapital One Investing’s Express Funding tool is unusual among online brokerages. It allows you to make purchases for an individual, joint, or retirement account without first depositing the funds necessary to back it up.Once you make your purchase, Capital One Investing draws the funds from a checking or savings account that’s tied to your brokerage account. If the tied account lies outside of the Capital One 360 ecosystem, Express Funding trades cost an extra $6.95. This comes on top of the $6.95 commission for non-automatic trades, bringing the total cost of the trade to $13.90. Express Funding transactions that use Capital One 360 checking or savings accounts don’t include this additional charge.Capital One Investing allows you to have $5,000 in outstanding Express Funding trades at any given time. Once each transaction posts, its value drops off of this outstanding balance, freeing up space for additional trades. Transactions placed before 5pm Eastern generally post on the same business day.Access to IPOsCapital One Investing allows regular investors to get \\xa0in on IPOs (initial public offerings), which are \\xa0the first share offerings of newly listed companies. The platform’s IPO Center serves as a clearinghouse and research center for upcoming offerings. Check it periodically to see what’s coming around the bend – pending IPOs are usually added soon after they’re announced.Capital One Investing is careful to note that the mere presence of the IPO Center doesn’t guarantee that its customers will actually be able to purchase IPO shares, since pricing on these transactions tends to be extremely volatile and traders must act quickly to adjust their offers on the day of the IPO. For alert traders who have a high tolerance for risk, this can be a useful tool that isn’t uniformly available at low-cost brokerages.Customer Support OptionsYou can get in touch with Capital One Investing’s customer support team by phone from 8am to 9pm Eastern, Monday through Friday. Live chat hours are similar. Support emails are generally answered within one business day.Note that some Capital One Investing teams have shorter hours. For instance, Capital One Advisors is available 8:30am to 5:30pm, Monday through Friday.Tax CenterCapital One Investing’s Tax Center lets you monitor the tax implication of your account activity.The gain-loss reports show exactly how much you’ve earned or lost on each transaction during a given tax year, as well as the\\xa0cost basis for each position that you’ve held. The 1099 tax forms page includes 1099-B (proceeds from profitable sales), 1099-INT (proceeds from interest), and 1099-DIV (proceeds from dividends) forms for each tax year.Although you can opt to receive these documents by mail, it’s useful to have them online as well.Advantages1. Reasonable PricingEven among low-cost online brokerages, Capital One Investing has a reputation for relatively low commissions and fees. Commissions are $6.95 to trade\\xa0stocks, options, mutual funds, ETFs, and bond funds, although options have an additional cost of $0.75 per contract. These commissions are lower\\xa0than most direct competitors, which can charge as much as $10 per online trade. Capital One Investing’s ShareBuilder Investment Plan feature is even cheaper – just $3.95 per automatic trade. In other words, setting up your weekly trades ahead of time (and giving up some control over their timing, since all automatic trades execute on Tuesday) reduces your commissions by about 40%.2. Solid Bonuses for New AccountsOther brokerages offer new-account bonuses, but few are as generous to smaller investors as Capital One Investing. An opening deposit of just $5,000 qualifies you for a $50 bonus. If you’re farther along on the road to financial independence, bring $200,000 to the table and reap a $600 bonus – among the top new account hauls available anywhere in the low-cost online brokerage space.3. Retirement Options for Small Business OwnersMany low-cost brokerages only offer individual IRAs. Capital One Investing’s is one of the only brokerages at its price point – sub-$7 base commission – that offers 401k options for small businesses. Even some pricier brokerages that market themselves as full-service alternatives to discount brokers – a category that includes TD Ameritrade and Fidelity – lack specific 401(k) plans for small business owners. Capital One Investing’s decision to offer this product makes it very attractive for business owners who don’t want to pay a professional investor to manage their employees’ retirement funds.4. Drama-Free Recurring Automatic InvestmentsSome other brokerage firms offer automatic investment programs, but Capital One Investing’s $3.95 commission is more affordable than what traders can find elsewhere. Even better, Capital One Investing’s automatic\\xa0dividend reinvestment program (DRIP)\\xa0is free for most securities. Surprisingly, many online brokerages have yet to follow suit.5. Affordable Phone TradesCapital One Investing’s phone trading service is far more affordable than most competing brokerages’. At less than $20 per trade, it’s not cheap – but most competitors charge at least $30 for the same service.6. No Account Minimums for Non-Managed AccountsMany low-cost online trading platforms, including Capital One Investing, waive minimum deposits for new accounts. But some, especially those catering to professional day traders, do require substantial opening deposits – sometimes in excess of $10,000.The only exception to this rule is Capital One Advisors Managed Portfolios, which requires at least $25,000 to open an account. That’s actually a reasonable starting deposit for portfolios managed by human advisors though.7. Express Funding Lets You Invest Your Money Before It’s AvailableCapital One Investing’s Express Funding feature eliminates the need to transfer funds to your brokerage account before filling a buy order. By linking your Capital One Investing account directly with an outside bank account – or a Capital One 360 bank account, which eliminates the additional $6.95 fee for Express Funding\\xa0– this tool\\xa0basically turns your bank account into an extra source of cash for your investing activities.This feature is virtually unique in the low-cost online brokerage space. Most brokerages do offer real-time inbound transfers that allow you to trade with transferred funds almost immediately after initiating the deposit, but this still requires an extra step on your part.Disadvantages1. No Access to Individual BondsUnlike TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, and some other discount and full-service online brokerages, Capital One Investing doesn’t allow individual bond purchases. The company frames this as a customer-friendly move that reduces risk and eliminates the complexities of individual bond buying – and it’s true that new or low-net-worth investors may\\xa0have little reason to purchase individual corporate or Treasury bonds. But that doesn’t change the fact that experienced investors who want the freedom to purchase individual corporate or government bonds through their brokerage account won’t find it here.2. Managed Portfolios Are PriceyCapital One Advisors’ annual Managed Portfolio management fee is 0.9% of assets under management, plus commissions and fund expenses. That’s pricier than most automated or semi-automated advisory platforms, which typically charge less than 0.5% AUM. There’s also no graduation – the 0.9% AUM rate applies to all invested balances, from $25,000 on up past $1 million.3. Account Holders Can’t Sell Stocks ShortCapital One Investing doesn’t allow its account holders to sell equities short under any circumstances.\\xa0Short selling is a relatively risky strategy by which experienced investors can profit from falling stock prices. Unlike long investing, whereby investors buy shares of a stock at a low price in the hopes of selling them later for more money, short selling\\xa0involves borrowing shares of a stock in order to sell them at a specific price, then using a portion of the proceeds from that sale to repurchase them in the future at a lower price.The short seller’s profit is equivalent to the spread between the initial sale price and the (hopefully lower) buy price. Since short selling represents a bet that the price of a stock will fall, it can backfire when the target stock’s price rises. As such,\\xa0it’s decidedly not recommended for novices.Many full-service brokerages, including TD Ameritrade and Fidelity, allow account holders to execute short sales. Capital One Investing does offer margin accounts for qualified investors (you need to formally apply for the privilege). Margin accounts allow traders to leverage their accounts by\\xa0borrowing up to double the amount of cash that they currently have available for trading – but only for long trades.4. No Forex ExposureCapital One Investing doesn’t give account holders access to an increasingly popular activity for experienced retail investors: currency trading, or forex.\\xa0Since forex markets are truly global, it’s possible to buy and sell any commonly traded currency – the vast majority of forex volume involves the U.S., Canadian, and Australian dollars, as well as the Euro, Swiss franc, yen, and pound – as long as an open global market is available. (In the United States, this period runs continuously from the middle of Sunday afternoon until the dinner hour on Friday.)While Capital One Investing may carry mutual funds and other equities with indirect exposure to global currency markets, it’s not the place to go for direct access. If currency trading is an important piece of your investing strategy, you’ll want to look elsewhere – perhaps in an unexpected place, like WorldCurrency CDs from EverBank, a Florida-based online bank.5. ShareBuilder Plan Trades Only Happen on TuesdaysAutomatic recurring investments made through the ShareBuilder Investment Plan only happen on Tuesday. This seems like an arbitrary limitation with potential negative implications for market timing. Most full-service platforms let you customize the timing of your recurring investments, or at least offer greater flexibility with regards to how and when they’re executed.Final WordCapital One Investing is one of many low-cost online brokerages that bring everyday investors much closer to the stocks, options, and funds that they trade. The platform’s low cost – just $6.95 for a regular online trade – is particularly noteworthy, as is an automatic investing program that costs just $3.95 per trade. Unlike some other online brokerages, Capital One Investing offers retirement accounts for both individual investors and small business owners. It’s also notable for its lack of minimum funding requirements and attractive new account bonuses.On the other hand, Capital One Investing doesn’t offer access to individual bonds, including corporate bonds and treasuries. It also doesn’t allow investors to sell stocks short (although it does allow margin accounts), which is a major drawback for advanced investors who want flexibility to take advantage of a range of market conditions.Overall, Capital One Investing is a great tool to use if you’re just starting out as an investor and want to hone your skills on your own terms, and it offers even clearer advantages for current Capital One 360 customers. Experienced or high-net-worth investors should definitely look at more comprehensive brokerages before opening an account with Capital One Investing.Do you use an online brokerage to invest for retirement, to make extra income, or earn a full-time living? What’s your experience with Capital One Investing?Related14.5K Views29 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInRating: 4.2Updated: November 8, 2017VERDICTCapital One InvestingCapital One Investing is a low-cost online brokerage that’s ideal for self-directed investors. With plenty of value-added research and comparison tools, it’s a self-contained resource for the average retirement investor. Capital One Advisors Managed Portfolios are suitable for long-term investors with neither the time nor inclination to manage their own investments, provided they can afford the annual management fee and $25,000 account minimums.Capital One Investing’s self-directed platform falls short for active traders and advanced investors seeking exposure to alternative investments and asset classes, and Managed Portfolios are spendier than comparable alternatives offered by partially or fully automated competitors (though said competitors have drawbacks of their own).Score: 4.2 out of 5 starsKey benefits include a reasonable commission structure, nice new account bonuses, retirement options for small business owners (including sole proprietors), drama-free recurring automatic investments, reasonably priced phone trades, rapid funding via Express Funding (with no fees transferred from Capital One 360 accounts), and no account minimums for non-managed accounts.Drawbacks include no forex exposure, no individual bond exposure, no short selling, pricey managed portfolios (relative to automated and semi-automated alternatives), and the “Tuesday only” requirement for automatic investments.Overall, Capital One Investing is ideal for frugal investors capable of self-directing their own investments, and for hands-off investors who prefer to (and can afford to) pay an advisor to handle day-to-day investment decisions. It’s not suitable for advanced investors and those seeking exposure to alternative assets.Related ArticlesVanguard Brokerage Review - Retirement Funds & Investments LOYAL3 Review - Buy & Sell Stocks Online for Free Country Wisdom & Investing - 6 Old-Time Sayings Relevant to Your Finances Why You Need a Taxable Brokerage Account in Addition to an IRA & 401k Is Active Investing Right For You?

Airline rewards cards offer opportunities to fly for free or on the cheap, reducing the cost of your vacations and business trips. Dining rewards cards reduce the cost of restaurant meals, often a major expense on trips. Many cash back credit cards give you a percentage back on all of your most important purchases, while gas rewards credit cards literally pay you to buy gasoline and make other purchases at gas stations.If you travel frequently, one or more of these card types have a place in your wallet – and so do hotel rewards credit cards. Virtually every major hotel company or brand family has at least one rewards credit card. Some cater to individual travelers, and others are meant for business owners.Every hotel rewards card is a little different, but the basic premise is consistent: purchases earn you points that can be redeemed for free or discounted nights, incidental hotel expenses (such as meals or spa treatments), and sometimes other travel expenses, such as airfare. Several hotel credit cards have more expansive rewards programs, offering merchandise, gift cards, and other valuable items that have nothing to do with hotels. Most hotel credit cards have extensive perks and benefits, and many have enticing promotions and sign-up bonuses.Best Hotel Credit Cards (Branded)Keep in mind that the majority of these cards come with annual fees. While the lack of an annual fee is certainly nice, no-annual-fee cards often come with foreign transaction fees – meaning they’re less than ideal for frequent international travelers. Plus, they tend to have fewer fringe benefits than annual-fee cards.1. Starwood Preferred Guest® Credit Card from American Express2 Starpoints Per $1 Spent at Starwood & Marriott Properties; 1 Point Per $1 Everywhere Else; 20% Transfer Bonus to Frequent Flyer ProgramsThe Starwood Preferred Guest Card from American Express earns you 2\\xa0Starpoints per $1 spent on eligible purchases at participating Starwood (including Sheraton, Westin, and W) and Marriott properties with no spending limits or restrictions. All other purchases earn an unlimited 1 point per $1 spent, with no spending limits or restrictions. The $95 annual fee is waived during the first year.Starpoints can be redeemed for free nights and room upgrades at Starwood hotels. You can also transfer Starpoints to participating frequent flyer programs – about 30 in all, covering 150 airlines. If you transfer at least 20,000 points, you get a 5,000 Starpoint bonus (20%). Whether you redeem Starpoints for hotel stays or airfare, there are never any blackout dates.The Starwood Preferred Guest Card has an excellent sign-up bonus too: 25,000 Starpoints points when you spend at least $3,000 in purchases within the first 3 months. Free global WiFi access and a lack of foreign transaction fees are nice perks.Note that there’s a business\\xa0version of this card:\\xa0Starwood Preferred Guest Business Card from American Express.Sign-up Bonus. Earn 25,000 Starpoints when you spend at least $3,000 in purchases within the first 3 months of card membership. That’s worth up to 12 free nights at Category 1 Starwood properties.Hotel Rewards. 2\\xa0Starpoints per $1 spent on eligible purchases at Marriott and Starwood properties, including Westin, W, and Sheraton, and 1 Starpoint per $1 spent on all other purchases. No spending limits or restrictions.Redemption. Starpoints can be redeemed for free nights and room upgrades at Starwood hotels with no blackout dates, transferred to frequent flyer miles, and used to book flights directly with airlines. It takes 3,000 Starpoints to redeem for a Category 1 (lowest property tier) night and up to 35,000 for a Category 7 (highest tier) night. You can combine points and cash to redeem faster: 1,500 points plus $30 for a Category 1 property, up to 15,000 points plus $275 for a Category 7 property. Category 1 room nights often cost less than $100. Category 3 hotels are generally moderately priced – for instance, a midweek standard room at the Category 3 Sheraton Birmingham (Alabama) Hotel costs $187 per night. Category 7 hotels are super pricey, but very luxurious – for example, the ultra-luxe St. Regis Residence Club Aspen’s rooms start at $1,099 per night. Note that category tiers don’t always correlate with room prices – in Birmingham, the Category 4 Aloft Birmingham Soho Square is actually cheaper per night ($169 and up) than the Category 3 Sheraton Birmingham ($187 and up). Starpoints can be transferred to frequent flyer miles at a 1-to-1 ratio with most participating airlines, and you get a 5,000-point bonus for every 20,000 miles you transfer. Direct airline redemptions are based on flights’ dollar value, with cost ranges corresponding to fixed point requirements. For instance, flights that cost less than $150 require 10,000 points, flights priced between $410 and $475 require 35,000 points, and flights priced between $995 and $1,060 require 80,000 points.Preferred Customer Status.

Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card2x Points on Travel & Dining at Restaurants; 1-to-1 Transfer to Participating Frequent Traveler ProgramsThe information related to the\\xa0Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card has been collected by Money Crashers and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of this card.The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is simple, elegant, and powerful. Purchases on travel and dining at restaurants earn 2 Ultimate Rewards points per $1 spent, with no spending caps or restrictions. All other purchases give you 1 point per $1 spent. You can also transfer points to participating frequent traveler programs, such as Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards and IHG Club Rewards, at a 1-to-1 ratio. For instance, 1,000 Ultimate Rewards points equal 1,000 IHG Club points. This card does have a $95 annual fee, though it is waived in the first year.When redeemed for airfare and hotel purchases through Chase’s Ultimate Rewards portal, you get 20% off, making your Ultimate Rewards points worth up to $0.0125 apiece. You can also redeem for gift cards, cash (statement credits, direct deposits, or checks), and merchandise, mostly at a $0.01-per-point rate. The redemption minimum is 2,000 points for cash redemptions.Finally, Chase Sapphire Preferred has a solid sign-up bonus: 50,000 bonus Ultimate Rewards points when you spend at least $4,000 within 3 months.Sign-up Bonus.

You also don’t need to accumulate enough Ultimate Rewards points to pay for an entire room night or stay – simply use whatever points you have and pay the rest with your Sapphire Preferred card. Since Ultimate Rewards points have fixed values, there is no financial advantage to booking at higher-priced (e.g., Category 7) or lower-priced (e.g., Category 1) hotels.

You can also exchange your Honors points for miles with many popular airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Delta Airlines.

Per-night hotel redemption requirements range from 10,000 to 60,000 points, depending on the property brand and quality level. The amount of points required for redemption doesn’t always correspond to a hotel’s nightly rates – for instance, the Crowne Plaza Denver’s standard midweek rooms start at $161 or 30,000 points per night, while the nearby Holiday Inn Express Denver Downtown’s standard midweek rooms start at $198 or 20,000 points per night, which is a much better deal. Hotels in popular areas tend to require more points – for example, the Intercontinental: New York Times Square costs at least $399 (or 60,000 points) for a midweek single-night stay. You can also combine points and cash – for instance, you can get a free standard room at the Holiday Inn Express Denver Downtown for 10,000 points plus $70, or a free standard room at the Intercontinental: New York Times Square for 50,000 points plus $70.Preferred Customer Status.

Marriott Rewards® Premier Credit Card5 Marriott Rewards Points For Every $1 Spent at Marriott, Ritz-Carlton & Starwood Hotels; 2 Points for Airline, Rental Car & Restaurant PurchasesThe information related to the\\xa0Marriott Rewards Premier credit card has been collected by Money Crashers and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of this card.The Marriott Rewards Premier Credit Card earns you 5 Marriott Rewards points for every $1 spent at Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, and Starwood Preferred Guest hotels worldwide.

There are no spending caps on any category, and the card carries an $85 annual fee.Redemption minimums vary by hotel class, but start at 7,500 points (6,000 points if you book with PointSavers, which offers discounts at a limited, rotating slate of hotels) and range up to 45,000 points.The Marriott Rewards Premier Credit Card also has a very generous sign-up bonus: When you spend just $3,000 in the first 3 months of card membership, you get 80,000 Marriott Rewards points.

When you throw the attractive sign-up bonuses that so many cards feature into the mix, the category gets even more exciting.However, that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to throw caution to the wind and apply for new cards as fast as your fingers can type. Opening multiple credit card accounts within short time-frames can damage your credit score, sometimes with dramatic consequences. If you’re not careful, you could find yourself applying for a secured credit card in an effort to rebuild your credit. Plus, if you’re not paying off your entire statement balance each month, the interest you end up paying will likely exceed the value of any rewards you earn.What is your favorite hotel credit card?Related53.8K ViewsFacebookTweetPinLinkedInEditorial Note: The editorial content on this page is not provided by any bank, credit card issuer, airline, or hotel chain, and has not been reviewed, approved, or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities.

Cash back credit cards can be even more popular than our top-rated gas credit cards and travel rewards cards.But not all cash back credit cards are created equally.Some offer the same cash back rate on all purchases. Others offer higher cash back rates on certain spending categories, such as groceries or gas, and lower rates on everything else. Others offer bonus cash back on spending categories that rotate every quarter. A few accrue cash back on purchases and monthly payments. And some cash back cards even hew to hybrid models, with cash back on certain spending categories and different types of\\xa0rewards (such as airline miles) on others.You’ll find each type of card on this list of the best cash back cards available to U.S. consumers today.\\xa0Keep in mind that most cash back credit cards require applicants to have very good to excellent credit – usually indicated by a credit score above 700, and sometimes even higher. If you don’t meet that threshold, work on building your credit before applying.Best Cash Back Credit Cards1. Chase Freedom Unlimited®1.5% Cash Back on All Purchases; Sign-up Bonus Worth $150 + $25Chase Freedom Unlimited\\xa0is similar to the flagship Chase Freedom Card, but with an important distinction: Instead of flat 1% cash back and rotating 5% cash back categories with quarterly spending caps, it simply earns an unlimited 1.5% on all purchases. You can redeem for virtually anything, in any amount, at the Chase Ultimate Rewards® portal – including cash equivalents, merchandise, and travel.Chase Freedom Unlimited\\xa0has a great (and sometimes overlooked) perk for loyal Chase credit card customers.\\xa0If you also have the\\xa0Chase Ink Business Preferred\\xa0($95 annual fee) card or\\xa0the\\xa0Chase Sapphire Preferred ($95 annual fee) travel rewards card, you can transfer points earned through Freedom Unlimited\\xa0to those accounts. You can then transfer those\\xa0points at a 1-to-1 ratio to approximately ten frequent traveler programs, or redeem them\\xa0for travel purchases through the Ultimate Rewards portal and receive a 20% bonus (for instance, boosting the value of a 50,000-point redemption to $625). However, keep in mind that you need to apply for Ink Plus or Sapphire Preferred – and remember, having Chase Freedom Unlimited\\xa0doesn’t necessarily qualify you for those cards.Sign-up Bonus.\\xa0You get a $150 cash bonus when\\xa0you spend at least $500 within three months of account opening. You also get an additional $25 bonus when you make your first purchase, add an authorized user, and the authorized user makes their first purchase within three months of your account opening date.Cash Back Rate. Unlimited\\xa01.5% cash back on all purchases.Redemption. You can redeem your accumulated cash back rewards in any amount.

Barclaycard CashForward™ World Mastercard®1.5% Cash Back on All Purchases; 5% Redemption Bonus;\\xa0$200 Sign-up BonusLike the Capital One\\xa0Quicksilver and\\xa0QuicksilverOne cards, Barclaycard CashForward™ World Mastercard® earns 1.5% cash back on all purchases, with no spending caps or rotating categories. It also offers a 5% redemption bonus that automatically boosts redeemed cash back by 5% – so a $100 redemption becomes $105. This essentially increases\\xa0the effective cash back rate to 1.575%.\\xa0You can redeem for a statement credit, gift card, or bank account deposit.One significant drawback is the rather high cash back redemption limit. Whereas most other cash back cards allow\\xa0you redeem in amounts greater than $10 or $20, and sometimes in any amount, this card requires at least $50 before you can redeem.Sign-up Bonus.\\xa0You get a $200 cash bonus when\\xa0you spend $1,000 within\\xa090 days of account opening.Cash Back Rate. Unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases.Redemption. The minimum redemption is $50. You can redeem for statement credits, gift cards, or bank account deposits.

Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express6% Cash Back at Supermarkets; 3% at Gas Stations and Department Stores; 1% Elsewhere; Up to $350 Sign-up BonusIf you love the supermarket, you’ll love the\\xa0Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express. You get 6% cash back on all supermarket transactions, up to a $6,000 annual spending limit. Once you hit $6,000, you get 1% back on supermarket purchases, with no upper limit. There’s no spending limit on the gas station and department store categories – you get 3% cash back on every $1 spent in those places, period. And you get 1% cash back on all other purchases, with no limits.Cash back comes as a statement credit. However, there’s a significant drawback: a $95 annual fee.Another smaller\\xa0drawback of the\\xa0Blue Cash Preferred card is American Express’s restrictive definition of “supermarket.” Superstores like Walmart, wholesale clubs like Costco, and alcohol retailers aren’t considered as supermarkets for this card’s purposes. The annual fee does cut into your earning potential somewhat – but since the 6% supermarket cash back doubles what most competing cards offer, you’re still likely to come out ahead if you take full advantage of this category.If you’re struggling to meet your $6,000 annual supermarket spending limit with food and dry goods purchases alone, make up the difference by purchasing other merchants’\\xa0gift cards\\xa0at the supermarket checkout counter. It’s like getting an immediate 6% discount at your favorite restaurants, retailers, and e-commerce websites.Sign-up Bonus.

There’s a $95 annual fee. The foreign transaction fee is 2.7%. Balance transfers cost either $5 or 3% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater.Other Perks. If you attempt to return a purchased item within 90 days and the merchant refuses to accept it, Amex’s Return Protection policy refunds the item’s entire purchase price, up to $300 per item and $1,000 per calendar year.See our Blue Cash Preferred from American Express Review for more information.\\xa0Find out how you can apply for this card\\xa0here.

Chase Freedom®5% Cash Back in Rotating Categories Every Quarter;\\xa01% on Everything ElseAll purchases made with the Chase Freedom card earn 1% cash back, with no caps or restrictions, and purchases up to $1,500 in quarterly rotating categories earn 5% cash back (e.g., gas stations and local commuter transportation\\xa0for Q1 2017).

Capital One® QuicksilverOne® Cash Rewards Credit Card1.5% Cash Back on All Purchases; Lower Credit RequirementsCapital One QuicksilverOne is very similar to the Quicksilver card. You get 1.5% on all purchases, all the time, with no spending limits or rotating categories. Cash redemption procedures are the same, as are the card’s general benefits and restrictions. The biggest differences are a modest annual fee ($39), no sign-up bonus, and a higher variable APR for the\\xa0QuicksilverOne card.The main benefit of the QuicksilverOne is its relatively lax credit history requirements. Whereas the\\xa0Quicksilver card (like most cash back credit cards) requires excellent credit,\\xa0QuicksilverOne requires merely “average” credit, though Capital One doesn’t specify exactly what this means.The flip side of this is that most new cardholders don’t qualify for high credit limits.

Points vary in value from $0.005 to $0.01, depending on how you redeem, so every $1 spent at the supermarket (where you get 3x points) is worth between $0.015 and $0.03. After you hit the limit, supermarket and gas purchases still earn 1\\xa0point per dollar.\\xa0Note that there’s a $95 annual fee on this card.The frequent-purchase points bonus is juicier than the non-preferred version of the card, too, if you can manage it: You get a 50% point bonus when you make at least 30 purchases per billing cycle, an average of about one purchase per day. Redemption procedures and values are identical to the regular\\xa0Amex EveryDay.Keep in mind that, due to this card’s $95 annual fee, it’s only a good deal if you use it frequently – ideally, enough to qualify for the 50% monthly point bonus.

Otherwise, a more traditional cash back card may be in order.Sign-up Bonus.

Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa Credit CardWells Fargo Cash Wise Visa is one of a growing cohort of “1.5% cards” – cash back credit cards that earn a flat, unlimited 1.5% return on spending.

Cards that offer more than 2% or 3% cash back typically require holders to keep track of specific spending categories or respect purchase limits.By contrast, cash back credit card APRs usually range from somewhere north of 10% to more than 20% in some cases. At those rates, carrying a balance for even a single month can seriously eat into your cash back earnings. Habitually carrying a balance from month to month more than\\xa0negates your cash back earnings, adding to the actual cost of your purchases.In other words, don’t let the promise of cash back lull you into letting your card balances grow over time. It’s almost never worth it. If you\\xa0need to carry a credit card balance from month to month, opt for a low APR credit card instead. And if you worry about your ability to keep your credit card spending to a level that allows for in-full payments each month, choose a credit card with a low spending limit, or a secured credit card that requires you to make an upfront cash deposit.What’s your favorite cash back credit card?Related612K Views30 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInEditorial Note: The editorial content on this page is not provided by any bank, credit card issuer, airline, or hotel chain, and has not been reviewed, approved, or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities.

Since then, it has dramatically expanded its offerings to cater to retirement savers, high-asset clients, business owners, and advanced investors who want access to currencies and precious metals. It\\xa0offers a robust lineup of banking services, as well as brokerage accounts for investors through EverTrade Direct Brokerage.There are about a dozen EverBank branches\\xa0scattered around the state, from Boca Raton in the south to Jacksonville in the north. Especially in northern Florida, EverBank is a big deal; in fact, a while back, the company bought the naming rights to the Jaguars’ home stadium – although, as Jacksonville is the\\xa0NFL’s smallest market, that might\\xa0be a dubious feat – and the bank is a visible patron of local events and charities.Outside of the Sunshine State, EverBank has about a dozen physical offices that specialize in mortgage and business lending, mostly in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado. If you’re from anywhere else, however, do not fear – EverBank’s online bank offers access to all services available at these two types of locations, and then some.Key FeaturesYield Pledge Checking AccountEverBank’s Yield Pledge Checking Account, billed as one of the oldest high-yield checking accounts, offers competitive interest rates, no account maintenance fees, and no-cost overdraft protection for clients who link their accounts to\\xa0an EverBank savings or money market account. The Yield Pledge name evokes a longstanding\\xa0EverBank\\xa0policy: Its interest rates always remain within the top 5% of all U.S. banks’ interest rates, as defined by Bankrate.com’s BRM National Index, which updates at the beginning of each month.Upon opening a new account, for which a minimum deposit of $5,000 is required, account holders currently receive a 12-month introductory interest rate of 1.21% for balances up to $250,000. The current standard interest rate sits at 0.25% on balances up to $10,000, and rises to a maximum rate of 0.71% on balances between $100,000 and $10,000,000.Yield Pledge Money Market AccountEverBank offers a money market account under the Yield Pledge banner. This\\xa0account\\xa0guarantees that its rates remain\\xa0in the top fifth percentile of all U.S. banks, as defined by the Bankrate.com BRM National Index, which is updated monthly. Everbank requires a $5,000 opening deposit and allows up to six outbound transfers or withdrawals per month, as per federal regulations – inbound transfers and deposits are unlimited.As with EverBank’s checking account, no monthly maintenance fees are associated with this product. New accounts are eligible for a 12-month introductory\\xa0interest rate of 1.31% on up to $250,000 in deposits.\\xa0Beyond\\xa0$250,000, the rate on all funds (up to $10 million) is 1.01%. After the first 12 months, the APY drops to 1.01% on all balances.\\xa0These rates are subject to change on a monthly basis, as per the BRM Index.Yield Pledge CDEverBank’s Yield Pledge CDs offer yet another top-fifth-percentile promise, again using the Bankrate.com BRM National Index as a benchmark. Like the company’s money market account, Everbank CDs\\xa0come with no maintenance fees, and require a $5,000 minimum deposit. Term lengths range from three months to five years, and interest rates range from 1.01% on the shortest-term vehicle to 2.35% on a five-year CD. The popular 12-month CD yields 1.68%. This rate schedule is unusually generous – EverBank is one of the few online banks whose entire CD catalog yields 1.00% or greater.Upon maturity, EverBank CDs\\xa0automatically roll over into identical vehicles, although the company does\\xa0provide 20 days of warning before the rollover\\xa0date. The penalty for withdrawing early is steep: 25% of all interest that would have been earned over the full term of the CD, for all CDs. This means that you can lose principal if you withdraw before your CD reaches the one-quarter mark of its term.Bump Rate CDEverBank’s Bump Rate CD has a 42-month term, during which account holders have the option to raise their rate once if prevailing rates rise. The Bump Rate CD’s APY starts at 2.10% on balances up to $250,000, which is also the maximum deposit amount. A minimum deposit of $1,500 is required to open a Bump Rate CD account. The maturity warning window is 20 days.LIBOR Index CDEverBank’s LIBOR\\xa0Index CD is a variable-rate CD with a 36-month term. The yield is directly tied to the three-month performance of the LIBOR Index, with a 0.25% margin added to the base LIBOR. When LIBOR rises, so does the yield, and vice versa. According to EverBank, the LIBOR Index CD is appropriate for savers who expect prevailing interest rates to rise over time. The minimum deposit amount is $1,500, and there’s a 20-day warning period prior to maturity. As of early 2017, the LIBOR Index is set at 1.31%, producing a 1.56% APY after accounting for the margin.Basic Checking AccountEverBank’s Basic Checking Account is \\xa0a no-yield checking account that requires a $25 minimum opening deposit and has no monthly account fees as long as you maintain an average daily balance of $25. If you don’t maintain the minimum daily balance, you pay $5 per month (except New York State residents, who are exempt by law).Basic Savings AccountThe Basic Savings Account is a lower-yield savings account that requires a minimum opening deposit of $25 and a minimum daily balance of $25 to avoid the $5 monthly account fee. The yield is 0.61% APY on all balances. As with the High-Yield Savings Account, outbound transfers are limited to six per month by federal regulations.Basic CDsEverBank’s Basic CDs have terms ranging from three months to five years. Yields are slightly lower than comparable-term Yield Pledge CDs, ranging from 0.91% APY on the three-month CD to 2.25% on the five-year CD. These yields apply to balances up to $1,000,000. There’s a $1,000 minimum deposit requirement for all accounts and a 20-day maturity warning.Foreign Denominated DepositsIndividuals and businesses\\xa0can deposit foreign currencies into\\xa0EverBank’s WorldCurrency accounts, which allow advanced investors and savers to take advantage of currency fluctuations to build their capital. These accounts currently offer access to approximately 20 foreign currencies, including popular denominations such as the Australian dollar, the euro, and the pound sterling, as well as less common varieties such as the Hungarian forint, Danish krone, and Polish zloty. Interest-bearing CD accounts are available in some – but not all – of these currencies.When an account holder deposits or redeems foreign-denominated funds for U.S. dollars (or vice versa), EverBank pays out\\xa0within 1% of the prevailing market exchange rate, which is an unpublished, variable rate that governs currency exchanges between banks. Basically, the markup that it charges for currency exchanges isn’t constant, but it does not\\xa0exceed 1% under normal circumstances.As deposit\\xa0accounts, all of EverBank’s foreign currency products are FDIC-insured up to a limit of $250,000 per account. However, this insurance only covers funds lost due to a failure of EverBank itself. It doesn’t cover potential losses due to depreciation of the currency in which your funds are denominated relative to the U.S. dollar.Visa Credit CardEverBank’s Visa Platinum Credit Card comes with no annual fee, and offers an optional rewards program\\xa0through FIS Points2U. This gives account holders the choice of receiving (for every $2,500 they spend) automatic $25 statement credits or accruing rewards points that can be redeemed for gift cards or direct purchases at participating restaurants, travel companies, and retailers and product manufacturers, such as Garmin, Brookstone, and Trek Bikes.\\xa0A full list of participating companies is available in EverBank’s rewards portal.Redemptions start at 750 points, which is equivalent to $750 spent. Redeeming your points through EverBank’s rewards portal doesn’t magnify your spending power – when you shop, each point has a value of one cent.You Might Also Like: Not sure EverBank’s Visa Platinum Card is right for you? Check out our credit card reviews page or peruse our roundup of the best cash back credit cards on the market.CDARS Service for Higher FDIC LimitsEverBank offers access to the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS), which provides FDIC insurance above the typical $250,000 account balance limit. The company’s CDARS products include 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month CDs that yield between 0.87% and 1.62%, depending on term length. There’s a $12.5 million funding limit on the three shorter-term CDs. The 24- and 36-month CDs have lower limits of $2.5 million and $1 million, respectively.All Everbank CDARS accounts require minimum deposits of $10,000, lack maintenance fees, and come with 15-day maturity warnings. Per CDARS’s regulations,\\xa0automatic rollovers aren’t available on these products. However, clients are free to open new CDARS accounts when their old ones mature.Mortgages and Refinancing ProductsEverBank markets traditional, jumbo and FHA/VA mortgages to individual clients. Within these categories, borrowers can find 15- and 30-year fixed mortgages, as well as 5/1 ARMs. Although rates vary according to borrowers’ credit scores, borrowing amount, and geographical location. For borrowers with excellent credit, rates are competitive with other major banks in the same geographical area.Everbank’s mortgage products\\xa0are available through the company’s\\xa0network of physical lending branches or partner lenders throughout the United States – it advertises a 50-state network of local partners. Current homeowners also can find a range of refinancing and leverage products, including home equity loans\\xa0and loans that shrink or lengthen terms on traditional and jumbo mortgages. In addition, the company also helps underwater homeowners (those who owe more than the current value of their homes) refinance their mortgages through the federal Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).Finally, Everbank offers access to the Federal Housing Authority’s Streamline Refinance Program. This is a limited-time initiative that also helps underwater homeowners remain in their homes.Precious Metal InvestmentsEverBank allows its brokerage and wealth management clients to\\xa0invest directly\\xa0in gold\\xa0and other commodities.\\xa0Interested account holders have two options.First, EverBank’s allocated accounts facilitate\\xa0direct, undivided\\xa0investment in physical gold and silver. With an allocated account, you can\\xa0take physical delivery of\\xa0individual bars or coins, including gold and silver bars that range from one to one hundred ounces, and one-ounce gold and silver coins issued by the American, Austrian, Canadian, and South African governments. These require a minimum deposit of $7,500 and accrue storage fees for clients who don’t take physical delivery.Second, unallocated accounts are previous metal investment pools with many different participants, and they don’t facilitate undivided ownership of physical gold or silver. However, unallocated accounts do facilitate\\xa0ownership of fractional shares of bars and coins – you own a specific amount of gold or silver, but you are not assigned to a particular bar or coin. They require a minimum one-time deposit of $5,000, or a commitment of at least $100 per month to an ongoing purchase plan.It’s not possible to take delivery of metals included in an unallocated account, but EverBank doesn’t assess storage fees on them either. EverBank’s\\xa0precious metals offerings aren’t FDIC-insured, but they are insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.Retirement AccountsIndividual EverBank account holders can open traditional and Roth IRA accounts, which can hold bank account products such as Yield Pledge\\xa0money markets and CDs, as well as foreign currencies, precious metals, stocks, options, bonds, and mutual funds.24-Hour Customer Service for Banking ClientsEverBank’s individual banking clients can call its Client Solutions Team 24 hours a day regarding their accounts. Banking support is also available on Twitter and via email, but there is no on-site chat feature. Debit and credit card clients can call separate numbers for 24-hour service as well. Mortgage, brokerage, and wealth management clients must call during business hours, which are\\xa08:30am to 5:30pm EST Monday through Thursday, and 8:30am to 4:30pm EST on Friday.Accounts for BusinessesEverBank offers a full lineup of accounts for business clients. These generally mirror its options for individual depositors – its checking, money market, CD, and CDARS accounts also apply to businesses – although rates on checking accounts for larger businesses are lower. EverBank also offers some business accounts that aren’t available to individuals, including a checking account that doesn’t pay any interest and a Business Analysis Checking product that provides fee credits for companies with high transaction volumes.Like individual depositors, business clients\\xa0can also open foreign-denominated accounts, but EverBank offers a special foreign exchange service for companies that need to exchange U.S. dollars for other currencies on a regular basis. This service offers better exchange rates than individual accounts, for\\xa0which currency exchanges can cost up to 1% of their total value. EverBank doesn’t offer retirement products, such as 401k plans,\\xa0for businesses.Commercial Real Estate FinancingEverBank offers commercial financing for real estate companies and individual landlords. These come in three forms: single-tenant properties, multi-tenant properties, and multifamily (residential) properties.On the first, EverBank can loan between $1 million and $50 million in fixed- or hybrid-rate loans with terms of 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years. Clients must put down at least 25% of the total loan value. Multi-tenant loans come with the same term lengths and down-payment requirements, but minimum loan amounts range from $500,000 to $10 million, and clients are required to prove a credit score of at least 680. Requirements for multifamily loans are identical to those for multi-tenant loans, except for a slightly less burdensome minimum down payment of 20%.Physical Bank LocationsFlorida residents can visit a local EverBank branch, and residents of Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma can walk into one of the company’s mortgage lending offices. Online-only banks, including Ally Bank and Capital One 360, require their customers to do all their banking online or over the phone.Mobile Banking ServicesEverBank’s Android- and iOS-compatible Mobilizer app includes many of its online banking features, including check deposit, bill pay, internal transfers, and balance checking. It also has an ATM-locating feature\\xa0and allows person-to-person payments through People Pay. However, EverBank does not offer mobile access to EverTrade brokerage accounts, making it difficult to trade equities on the go.ATM Fee ReimbursementAs long as they maintain account balances of $5,000 or greater during statement periods in which fees were incurred, checking and money market clients enjoy automatic reimbursement of fees charged at any\\xa0U.S. ATM.However, customers who don’t maintain this minimum and don’t have access to EverBank’s own ATMs, which are found mostly at its Florida branch locations, are liable for ATM fees when they withdraw their cash. These fees vary from machine to machine, depending on the policies of ATM operators. EverBank does not add an additional surcharge to these fees.Advantages1. Access to a Multitude of Savings and Investment VehiclesSome online banks, such as Ally Bank, are known for offering solid interest rates on a small number\\xa0of accounts – checking, savings, money market, and CDs for the former, and savings and CDs for the latter. Others, such as Capital One 360, allow users to open deposit accounts and trade securities\\xa0through an in-house brokerage account.EverBank offers the best of both worlds. In addition to common account types like checking and savings, which all offer competitive interest rates, EverBank lets depositors open accounts through which they can\\xa0purchase\\xa0precious metals or foreign currencies. Though EverBank no longer has an in-house brokerage, its close association with TIAA – which does offer brokerage services – is helpful.2. Lots of Options and Flexibility for High-Asset AccountsOn top of its comprehensive savings and investment options for rank-and-file clients, EverBank caters to high-asset account holders and small- to medium-sized business clients.Ally, Capital One 360, and FNBO Direct don’t work with CDARS, the organization that provides FDIC insurance on individual CDs worth more than $250,000. They also don’t have separate wealth management divisions that provide expert strategic advice and manage portfolios, which may include currencies, equities, bonds, CDs, and precious metals. Such services are more common at high-end investment firms like Franklin Templeton and full-service brokerages such as Schwab, which don’t have flexible deposit accounts like EverBank’s.3. ATM Reimbursements for Qualifying AccountsEverBank reimburses all ATM fees charged by U.S. banks on an unlimited basis, provided that the account holder maintains a balance of at least $5,000 during the\\xa0pertinent statement period. Some online banks, including Ally Bank, reimburse ATM fees as well. However, brick-and-mortar banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America are much more stingy about this, often limiting reimbursements during a statement period or refusing to reimburse any fees incurred outside their ATM networks.4. Highly Competitive Checking YieldsYields on EverBank’s checking accounts are far more generous than those of other banks. Many brick-and-mortar banks, such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America, don’t pay interest on funds in checking accounts – and yields on their savings accounts are often\\xa0laughably low as well, amounting to just less than 0.05% in both cases. With EverBank’s Yield Pledge, which is a literal pledge to keep its checking yields in the top fifth percentile relative to its U.S.-based competitors, customers don’t have to worry about rates not being competitive.5. No Overdraft Fees With Linked AccountsEven if they lack sufficient funds in their checking accounts, EverBank customers don’t have to pay overdraft fees if they link them with in-house money market or savings vehicles from which the bank can automatically pull. This safety net is limited by restrictions on outbound transfers – no more than six per statement period.EverBank also allows customers to opt in to a personal overdraft line of credit that provides a cash advance, at rates under 10%, in the event that the linked account lacks sufficient funds to cover an\\xa0overdraft.\\xa0There’s no fee for this credit line, but interest begins accruing on the day of the overdraft and continues to accrue until the full advance has been paid down. Customers who don’t want to open another account with EverBank can opt out of overdraft protection altogether.6. Low\\xa0Credit Card RatesEverBank’s Visa Platinum Credit Card comes with a lower standard APR (as low as 11% on purchases and balance transfers) than many other credit cards with similar terms, including products from Chase (like Chase Freedom Credit Card) and Citi (like Citi Double Cash Card).Additionally, it charges no annual fee and comes with a rewards program that pays $0.01 for every $1 in qualifying purchases, without earning caps. Your cash-back rewards can be redeemed as a statement credit or for purchases at qualifying retailers, restaurants, and travel companies. Few cards can claim this combination of low standard APR and a strong, no-limit rewards program, making the Visa Platinum Card a real standout.Disadvantages1. No High-Yield Savings AccountsFor such a comprehensive institution,\\xa0EverBank has a curious omission: It doesn’t offer any high-yield savings accounts in the mold of Ally’s High-Yield Savings Account, which always pays north of 1.00% APY. The upshot is that EverBank’s Yield Pledge Checking boasts savings account-like yields, and the Basic Savings account has a decent yield as well.2. High Minimum Deposit Requirements on\\xa0High-Yield AccountsEverBank’s Yield Pledge accounts have high minimum deposit requirements: $5,000 for Yield Pledge Checking, Money Market, and CD accounts. By contrast, many online banks, including Ally Bank, don’t require minimum deposits for checking, savings, or CD accounts with tangible yields.For savers who want to spread their money across multiple high-yield accounts or simply don’t have a lot to invest, EverBank’s account-size restrictions can quickly become onerous.\\xa0EverBank also imposes a\\xa0$5,000 minimum balance requirement for ATM fee reimbursements, creating a major drawback for checking account holders\\xa0who\\xa0can’t meet these minimums and aren’t near a physical EverBank branch. You can avoid minimum deposit and ongoing balance requirements with EverBank’s Basic accounts, but those accounts’ yields aren’t nearly as competitive (and, in the case of Basic Checking, are nonexistent).3. No Lending for Autos or Other Big-Ticket PurchasesEverBank’s individual and commercial mortgage options, not to mention its refinancing vehicles, have a lot to offer for prospective homebuyers and commercial real estate developers. Unfortunately, its lending operations don’t extend to auto lending or other\\xa0big-ticket purchases. By contrast, Ally Bank has a robust auto lending operation, and GE Capital Retail Bank offers financing for everything from furniture and residential appliances, to medical bills and jewelry.4. Limited Access to Fee-Free ATM WithdrawalsBanks with nationwide physical branch networks, such as Wells Fargo and Chase, have thousands of branded ATMs scattered about the country, making it easy for depositors to access their money without paying third-party ATM fees. By contrast, EverBank has a relative handful of its own ATMs (fee-free for all account holders), mostly at its dozen Florida bank branches. Unless they\\xa0can maintain a checking account balance of at least $5,000, EverBank customers who use their\\xa0debit cards at a non-EverBank ATM must pay any fees charged by the ATM’s owner.5. No In-House Brokerage or Wealth Management ServicesEverBank discontinued EverTrade, its in-house brokerage service, after merging with TIAA. EverBank customers can still invest with TIAA’s brokerage, which provides a range of options for passive and active investors, but there’s no way to do so directly through EverBank’s online banking portal. EverBank also discontinued its in-house wealth management vertical, a blow to the company’s high-net-worth customers.This change comes as some competing banks are embracing brokerage services. Ally Bank now has Ally Invest, for instance, and TD Bank has long had a close association with TD Ameritrade, a full-service broker. If you’re looking for a one-stop shop for spending, saving, and investing in stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and bonds, look to one of those options instead.Final WordEverBank is a full-service online bank that also has physical branches in Florida and a handful of mortgage lending outposts across the south-central United States. Its flagship product, the Yield Pledge Checking Account, offers one of the best checking account yields of any national bank, and its money market accounts and CDs are competitive, as well.At the same time, many EverBank accounts require high minimum deposits, and its ATM fee reimbursements don’t kick in until account holders keep more than $5,000 in a single checking account. Unlike Capital One 360, which actively caters to smaller savers and investors while limiting options for advanced investors and high-asset savers, EverBank definitely sets its sights on a wealthier, more discerning set.If you have ample reserves of cash and can easily clear the company’s minimums, you could reap solid\\xa0rewards from its high-yield accounts and personalized financial services. However, if you’re just starting out down the savings trail, a friendlier bank like Ally or Capital One 360 might be more your speed.Do you bank with EverBank?Related19 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInRating: 4.0Updated: November 9, 2017VERDICT Apply NowEverBankEverBank is ideal for affluent customers seeking high yields on checking, money market, and CD accounts. With more exotic offerings such as CDARS service and foreign-denominated accounts, it’s also useful for advanced savers and investors who need to park lots of money or seek exposure to less common assets. However, relatively high minimum deposit amounts for high-yield accounts, the lack of any savings account options, no in-house brokerage, and some key loan omissions hurt the case for EverBank.Score: 4.0 out of 5 starsKey benefits include access to a wide range of savings and investment vehicles, lots of options and flexibility for high-asset customers, ATM reimbursements for qualifying accounts, competitive checking yields for High-Yield Checking accounts, no overdraft fees with linked accounts,\\xa0and low credit card rates.Key drawbacks include no traditional savings accounts, high minimum deposit requirements on high-yield accounts, no auto lending, no in-house brokerage or wealth management services, and restrictions on fee-free ATM withdrawals.Overall, EverBank is a great full-service bank for those who can afford its minimums and get around its restrictions.Related ArticlesGE Capital Bank Review - Online Banking for Savings & CD Accounts Discover Bank Review - Online Banking for Savings, Money Markets & CDs Ally Bank Review - Online Bank With No Minimum Balance Required FNBO Direct Review - No Frills, Online High-Yield Checking Account Capital One Investing Review - Discount Broker for Long-Term Automatic Investing 11 Best Free Checking Accounts at U.S. Banks FacebookTweetPinLinkedInGoogle+StumbleUponPrintEmailCategories: Banking, Money Management, ReviewsBrian MartucciBrian Martucci is a blogger-journalist who writes about frugal living, entrepreneurship, and innovative ideas.

Does your car not fit in the garage anymore? If so, it might be time to get rid of a few things.Of course, that can be easier said than done. First of all, your garbage collector might not be amused if you deposit 30 bags of junk on the curb. Not to mention, it would probably feel like a waste to give up a glut of goods after all the money you invested in buying them.Fortunately, there are plenty of options at your disposal to get some money back from your clutter. Sites like eBay,\\xa0Craigslist, and Amazon\\xa0are great for clearing out clutter and pocketing some cash in the process. If you’re interested in getting rid of those old things lying around the home but you don’t quite know where to begin, here are some of the best ways to make money when you have too much stuff.eBayeBay was originally built as an online person-to-person auction website. At its core, it’s designed to allow private sellers from all over the world to post items for sale for a limited time. Potential buyers place bids, and when the time is up on the auction, the highest bid wins. The seller then ships the item to the buyer.While auctions are still commonplace on eBay, it’s increasingly used for fixed-price sales. Retailers can even register for business accounts on eBay to sell items.In order to sell goods on eBay, you must set up a seller account. You’re required to create an individual listing for each item you sell, and you’re responsible for managing those listings, paying attention to bids, and following up with the winning bidders.Selling on eBayeBay exposes your goods to a larger audience than any other person-to-person sales site in the world. It’s ranked among the 20 most-visited sites in the United States on SimilarWeb, and its viewership is not limited to the United States. eBay boasts\\xa0more than a billion visits per month globally. In other words, eBay\\xa0is not exactly your neighborhood garage sale.Auction-style Listings While eBay now offers fixed-price sales in addition to auction sales (and fixed-price sales are generating an increasingly larger share of the eBay market), eBay is still, at its core, an auction site.\\xa0In auction-style transactions, a posting is “live” for a limited amount of time. The lister may select a duration of\\xa01, 3, 7, or 10 days for the listing.More time means more potential eyes on the listing and, therefore, more bidders. However, shorter auctions create a greater sense of urgency and may motivate casual site visitors to spring into action.\\xa0At the end of the auction term, the buyer who has submitted the highest bid wins the auction.As a seller, if you have a unique or high-demand item (such as a designer purse or a rare collectible), you might get lucky enough to sit back and watch bidding wars drive the sales price far beyond expectations. However, the downside of the auction-style approach is that you may end up with a sales price that is significantly lower than you’d anticipated.There are two ways to circumvent this:Starting Prices.\\xa0You\\xa0have the option to set a starting price for your item, though you are not required to do so. If you start too high, many bidders will be turned off. However, starting too low may negatively impact the perceived value of your item.Reserve Pricing for Auction-Style Sales.\\xa0You\\xa0are allowed to create a minimum sales price for your item – a “reserve price” – but eBay charges you to do so ($3 per item for anything priced up to $149.99, and 2% of the reserve price for items priced at $150 or more, with a $100 maximum charge).Fixed-Price Listings Fixed-price sales are becoming more\\xa0common on eBay, stemming from both retailers and private sellers. When you choose this option, there is no bidding on your item and a buyer can purchase it immediately at the price you set.eBay Valet eBay Valet is eBay’s newest selling option. It’s basically a managed listing service that outsources most listing and shipping duties to eBay itself, greatly reducing the time and effort needed to create, maintain, and profit from your listings. Valets are big-time professional sellers that have been carefully vetted by eBay and are capable of selling more than 100,000 items per month.eBay Valet caters to sellers with unique or high-value items. Accepted items include designer clothing and accessories, electronics, antiques and collectibles, sporting goods, and musical instruments. Non-accepted items include anything in poor condition, anything worth less than $25, bulky or fragile items, anything weighing more than 25 pounds, media (such as CDs), jewelry and watches, and anything requiring a license or code to activate or unlock.To sell an item on eBay Valet, you print a free shipping label, box the item up at your local post office, and send it to your valet. The valet takes it from there, researching comparable item sales and creating a high-quality listing at a competitive price. For the convenience, you do have to forgo a significant share of the profit. You get 60% of the final sale price on items that sell for less than $50, 70% on items that sell for $50 to $200, and 80%\\xa0on items that sell for more than $200. You may also have to wait longer for your item to sell – valet transactions can take up to 60 days to complete, with payment coming two business days after the sale.“Buy It Now” Option for Auction-style Listings The “Buy it Now” option is a hybrid of the auction-style and the fixed-price sale methods. Sellers wishing to choose an auction-style sales format can include a price at least 30% higher than the starting bid, called the “Buy it Now” price. If buyers want to skip the auction process, they can opt to pay the “Buy it Now” price and secure the sale.Canceling Listings If you want to cancel your listing, you can do so at any time. However, certain restrictions apply if you have already received bids on your item.In such cases, sellers have the following options:Cancel and Sell to the Highest Bidder. You will not incur a fee if you cancel your listing and immediately sell to the highest bidder.Cancel at Least 12 Hours Before the End of an Auction and Refuse to Sell. As long as you’re outside the 12-hour window, you may cancel your listing even if it has bids, but you do have to pay eBay a fee equivalent to 10% of the final value. eBay waives this fee for the first cancellation of this kind in any calendar year.Cancel Your Listing Fewer Than 12 Hours Before the End of an Auction. If you have a bidder and you’re within the 12-hour window, you\\xa0must sell the item to the highest bidder, even if you choose to end the auction early and not wait for more bids.Payment and Shipping on eBayIf you’ve followed through with your listing and received a winning bid, it’s time to collect your money and get the item to the buyer. eBay owned PayPal for 12 years, and even though eBay spun it off into a separate company, PayPal is still the default method of sending and receiving payments on eBay.Signing up for a PayPal account requires connecting it to a credit card or bank account. If you wish to transfer received payments from your PayPal account to your bank account, then you must attach it to your bank account.Selling on eBay often involves transactions with people who live hundreds or thousands of miles away, which means shipping is an almost inevitable component of eBay selling. Buyers typically pay for shipping on eBay, but sellers should be aware of what it will cost so they can estimate appropriately. Be aware that extremely high shipping costs (such as 50% of the sales price) may turn sellers off, which is why big, heavy, or unwieldy items are less optimal on this platform.As a seller, you need to carefully pack your items in a way that preserves their quality throughout the shipping process. You can create and print a shipping label directly from eBay, but you still need to bring it to your post office unless you’ve arranged for pick-up. The U.S. Postal Service provides free pick-up that can be arranged online in advance. UPS and FedEx also offer pickup service, though fees may be incurred. If you sell through eBay Valet, you avoid seller shipping fees (including UPS and FedEx fees) and can rest assured that your items are carefully packed by professionals.When selling high-value items, you may want to pay for shipping insurance. If you’ve created a shipping label via eBay, you can purchase ShipCover insurance at a rate of $1.65 plus tax per $100 worth of coverage.\\xa0You do need to reveal your return address on the packing slip though – unless you have a P.O. box, that essentially means telling a stranger where you live.Advantages of eBayNo Other Site Drives More Eyes to Your Listing. More visitors means more potential sales. eBay’s international audience is unparalleled in size and scope, which is particularly useful if you have a rare, specialty, or collector’s item that might not readily appeal to a lot of buyers.\\xa0Perhaps your neighbors don’t appreciate the vintage Betty Boop vase your grandmother gave you, but eBay might just help you find someone whose collection is missing that very piece.You Can Sell From Home. Clearing out your storage closet and making money while wearing pajamas holds substantial appeal for many people.Allows You to Get Rid of Multiple Items at Once. Some eBay sellers combine more than one item into a “lot” – for example, a collection of vinyl records, back issues of magazines, toys, or clothes. However, keep in mind that lots may be a tough sell, as buyers are less likely to be in the market for a large number of goods, rather than a specific item.Free Listings, With Some Restrictions. You can list goods for free as long as you limit the total number of items to 50\\xa0per month.\\xa0After that threshold, you’re charged $0.30 to list each item – but that fee is credited back to you if your item sells. The $0.30 fee does not apply to art and collectibles. There are several upgrades that sellers can choose to draw more attention to their goods, but each comes with a cost. For example, you can pay $2 per item to have it listed in bold type.Hands-Off, Professional Listing Option. eBay Valet takes most of the effort out of listing and selling your items, and may result in a better listing (and higher sales price) than you can\\xa0pull off on your own.Disadvantages of eBaySeller Fees. eBay charges a “final value fee” of 10% of the sale price, with a maximum fee of $750 per item.Limited Information on Success Rates. A “sell-through rate” is the percentage of items that actually sell compared to the number of items listed for sale. Finding eBay’s official sell-through rate is nearly impossible – it’s not published, but Auctiva once estimated it to be approximately 40%. That adds up to a whole lot of disappointment and wasted effort.Slowing Revenue Growth. Like nearly every other industry, eBay took a major hit during the recession. It\\xa0bounced back in a big way, demonstrating 27% revenue growth in 2011, compared to 4% revenue growth the prior year. However, those numbers have slowed every year since. While eBay still reported 12% growth in 2014, that represents the third consecutive year of decreased growth. eBay’s monthly\\xa0visits were about 12% lower in April 2015 than April 2011, according to Statista. That means 12% fewer potential buyers for your item.Scams. Scams are common on eBay, and they can affect sellers as well as buyers. Buyers may claim never to have received an item – some even go so far as to alter a tracking number so the shipper can’t confirm that it arrived. Others might claim an item has been broken or damaged in shipping and demand a refund. You can purchase shipping insurance and file complaints with eBay, but there’s no guarantee of resolutions in your favor. Potential scams are simply a risk of doing business with people you don’t know.It May Be Difficult to Earn Buyers’ Trust. Buyers are encouraged to leave feedback about their experience with a particular seller. If you’re not a regular seller, the lack of ratings can serve as a red flag. Many potential buyers only engage in transactions with sellers who have high numbers of positive ratings. This is because sellers with poor or low numbers of ratings may be more likely to be scammers.Bottom LineeBay is good for people with a lot of product to sell, a computer with an Internet connection, and a little extra\\xa0time on their hands. It’s also ideal for people who have unique, specialty, or collector’s items with a niche audience. It’s not ideal for large items (such as furniture) that would be prohibitively expensive to ship.CraigslistLike eBay, Craigslist is a website designed to facilitate person-to-person sales. However, unlike eBay, Craigslist is dependent on physical geography. It’s\\xa0made up of\\xa0hundreds of individual websites tailored to specific areas, and buyers and sellers engage in transactions specific to their location – many people on Craigslist sell to buyers right across town.Thanks to the geographic component, Craigslist is a lot less anonymous than eBay and often involves in-person interaction\\xa0between buyers and sellers.\\xa0Sellers create posts listing items for sale, typically with a listed price – though “or best offer” sales are common – and interested buyers connect with them. Some sellers include personal contact information directly on a listing, but they also have the option of using a Craigslist-generated anonymous email address buyers can use. Final transactions typically take place in person.Craigslist is known for facilitating connections outside of traditional person-to-person sales. Businesses commonly list items for sale on Craigslist, and the site also features personal ads, job listings, real estate, and services.Selling on CraigslistCraigslist is nipping at eBay’s heels in terms of audience. It’s listed as the 12th-most-visited site in the United States, according to Alexa. Like eBay, Craigslist has tens of\\xa0millions of users per month in the U.S. and a heavy international presence, with more than 700 local sites in 70 countries.However, since Craigslist users typically buy and sell from the site specific to their own geographic location, it’s important to keep in mind that your item is only view-able to a fraction of Craigslist’s global audience. While you can only post on your local site, buyers do have the option to search on sites outside of their area.In spite of Craigslist’s wide reach, it doesn’t serve every location. Even if you’re technically within the fringes of a certain site’s span – in an extreme suburb, for example – you might find yourself connected with sellers who live hours away from you. Therefore, a $20 baby bouncer is likely to be a tougher sell if the buyer has to spend three hours on a round-trip to pick it up – and if you’re a seller who is offering delivery, you might spend more in gas than you can make on the sale.Craigslist’s posting process is very straightforward. All you have to do is come up with a title and category for your listing. You can add photos and a description with as much or a little detail as you choose. Once you’ve published your listing, it’s easy to edit it as needed.It’s free to post as many items as you want on Craigslist, with a few minor exceptions. Craigslist makes money by charging companies to post job listings in certain major markets, such as San Francisco. It also charges to post apartment rentals in New York City. Most everything else is free to post.Craigslist shows postings in chronological order. In a large market, in popular categories (such as household goods), new posts might show up every few seconds. That means that shortly after you’ve published your post, it could end up buried behind a hundred others.Craigslist makes it simple to renew a post and “bump” it to the top – simply click on a link in the confirmation email you received when you initially published it. However, you can’t refresh a listing until 48 hours have passed from the original posting. It’s a good idea to use as many keywords as possible in your item description – this improves the chances of someone (using the keyword search tool) landing on your post, even if it’s buried deep in the archives.The majority of posts expire after a limited time on Craigslist, especially in major markets where the flood of postings would\\xa0put a burden on Craigslist’s servers. Courtesy dictates that sellers remove items that have sold or are otherwise no longer on offer. Expiration dates vary by item and city, but general private sale listings, for example, last seven days in top markets and 45 days in other areas. Top markets include New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Boston, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Austin, Seattle, Portland, San Diego, South Florida (including Miami and Key West), Denver, Houston, Phoenix, Sacramento, and the San Francisco Bay Area.Advantages of CraigslistLocal Transactions. By dealing locally, you avoid the hassles of shipping and insurance. Plus, you have the added advantage of selling items appropriate to your location – surfboards in Hawaii, snowsuits in Minneapolis, and tickets to Red Sox games in Boston.Option for “Free” Listings. If you can’t sell your unwanted item on Craigslist, you can still\\xa0get rid of it by taking advantage of the “Free” section. Many people simply set their items on the curb and identify the posting as a “curb alert.” However, take note that this approach requires revealing your home address, which is a potential safety hazard.Limited Downside to Posting. Since there are no sales parameters (such as auctions, bids, or minimum sales prices), it’s a fairly low-risk proposition to post items on Craigslist. If you don’t get an acceptable offer, you are under no obligation to follow through with a sale, and you can delete your post anytime. It’s important to note that “low risk” refers to the process of listing and selling, not to engaging in transactions on Craigslist, which can make sellers and buyers vulnerable to scams and potential personal safety hazards.Disadvantages of CraigslistRisk of\\xa0Scams. Since payment transactions are not hosted on the site, Craigslist is arguably more susceptible to scams than eBay. Craigslist is vocal about warning sellers against engaging in transactions in which buyers insist on paying via cashier’s checks or bank transfers. You should always deal locally, though a possible exception to this rule is if you’re listing a specialty item and you receive an inquiry from an out-of-state buyer. Make sure to do your due diligence though – even performing a background check or asking authorities in the buyer’s location can be appropriate if the item is of high value. No matter what, don’t pay money up front to cover shipping.Personal Safety Hazards. Classified ad researcher AIM Group links 85 murders to Craigslist transactions, along with innumerable robberies. While the majority of people who sell and buy\\xa0on Craigslist are honest, it’s still very important to take precautions. Buyers commonly require sellers to pick up an item, but that shouldn’t mean inviting someone into your home. Agree to meet in a neutral location, and never engage in a transaction alone. You also shouldn’t put any personal details in an ad itself – and if you can, use an anonymous email address to exchange information with interested buyers. According to National Public Radio, many local police stations are\\xa0openly allowing people to conduct Craigslist transactions on police property in order to help ensure safety for both the sellers and the buyers.More Barriers to Completed Sales. As online platforms that securely broker payment and allow sellers to ship to anyone with a valid mailing address, eBay and Amazon have smoother, more predictable sales process. By contrast, much more can go wrong during the Craigslist sales process. For instance, buyers can decide\\xa0to back out after agreeing to the purchase but\\xa0before money is exchanged, or show up at the neutral site and drive a hard bargain in the hopes that the motivated seller will agree to a lower price.\\xa0These barriers are especially troublesome for higher-volume sellers, who can’t afford to devote lots of time and effort to each individual transaction.Bottom LineThe lack of fees for most items makes Craigslist a very low-risk enterprise ideal for big, heavy, or unwieldy items that aren’t practical for shipping or easily dropped off for donation. It’s also a great option for breakable items that would require special packaging to ship properly. When engaging in transactions via Craigslist, it’s best to request cash-only payments, and you should always meet buyers in a neutral, public location.AmazonAmazon is an “e-tailing” pioneer that got its start as an online bookseller back in the late 1990s. Today, it’s the world’s largest retailer by market capitalization. You can buy pretty much anything, new or used, on Amazon. Amazon is also a noted content and hardware producer, with best-selling products such as the Kindle e-reader and a growing slate of original shows.Like eBay, and unlike Craigslist, Amazon isn’t reliant on physical geography. As long as they both have mailing addresses, any two individuals or companies can complete Amazon transactions. That said, Amazon is not solely, or even primarily, a person-to-person retail platform. Sellers need to understand that their biggest competitor is the site itself.According to Amazon, only 40% of its total unit sales are generated by third parties, meaning direct-to-customer sales account for the remaining 60%.\\xa0This competitive environment favors experienced amateurs\\xa0and professionals sellers that trade in high volumes, rather than individuals clearing a handful of items out of the attic, basement, or garage.Items listed for sale on Amazon generally have firm prices – there’s no bidding or haggling here. Payment occurs securely through Amazon, typically by credit card or EFT, and items are almost always shipped by mail or private parcel service (as opposed to in-person delivery, the default option for Craigslist sales).Selling on\\xa0AmazonAmazon is ranked among the top 10 websites in the world, according to Alexa. In 2013, it passed Walmart as the world’s most valuable retailer in terms of market capitalization. With rapidly growing and diversifying opportunities for online sellers, it’s one of the best places to earn extra income selling unwanted items online.You can sell on Amazon as an individual or as a professional. The former is better for those who sell in relatively low volumes and don’t anticipate earning a living off their Amazon retailing (or online retailing in general). The latter is better for people who want to earn a living (or already do) selling things online.Selling as an Individual If you plan to sell fewer than 40 items per month, the Individual plan is a better deal financially. You pay nothing to list your items and nothing if they never sell. When an item sells, you pay a flat $0.99 fee, plus a variable referral fee (usually 6% to 20% of the sale price, with a minimum of $1, but can range up to 45% of the sale price for Amazon device accessories). Media items, such as books and DVDs, carry an additional closing fee – usually $1.35 per item, regardless of sale price. Individual sellers never pay Amazon subscription fees.Selling as a Professional If you plan to sell more than 40 items per month, the Professional plan makes more sense. It comes with a $39.99 monthly subscription fee, waived for the first month. Professional sellers pay no listing fees. They also don’t pay the flat $0.99 selling fee, though they’re responsible for the same referral and closing fees as Individual sellers.Listing and Selling Your Items Before you list an item, determine which Amazon product category it fits into. This could determine which plan you select, as some product categories (such as automotive) are only available to Professional sellers. Additionally, some categories, including automotive and beauty products, are “restricted.” To sell in a restricted category, you need\\xa0to ask Amazon’s explicit permission via the seller contact form, even if you’re a Professional seller. Some restricted categories, such as automotive, are only available to Professional sellers.Actually listing products on Amazon is easy, though it can be time-consuming for Individual sellers with multiple items. First, search Amazon for the item you plan to sell, noting the prices of similar or identical items. If the exact\\xa0product is already listed by another Amazon Marketplace seller, you can create your own listing under that product’s heading. To flesh out your listing, add high-quality images, specify quantity and quality or condition, set a competitive\\xa0price based on condition and quality, and list your shipping options.If the exact product is not yet on Amazon, you need to upload the UPC or EAN (European Article Number) and SKU, as well as a more detailed description of the product’s specifications and descriptive attributes. Following that, you must specify quantity, condition, price, and shipping. For products being added to the Amazon Marketplace for the first time, Amazon highly recommends uploading high-quality images.Amazon listings remain on the site indefinitely, disappearing only when products sell out. Buyers can sort item search results in a variety of ways, but lowest to highest price is most common, so your items will likely be more visible if they’re priced at or near the bottom of the pack. If you’re motivated to sell quickly, take advantage of selling tools such as Match Low Price, which automatically matches your listing’s price with the lowest prices on comparable Amazon-listed items.Payment and ShippingAmazon notifies you when your item sells. You can either handle shipping details yourself or outsource shipping to Fulfillment By Amazon, through which third-party sellers can leverage Amazon’s extensive (and growing) network of distribution hubs.DIY Fulfillment and Shipping When you handle shipping yourself, you’re responsible for printing packing slips, notifying buyers that their products are ready, neatly and safely packing products, sealing up packages such that they won’t deteriorate during the journey, and sending them via the U.S. Postal Service (which lets you arrange free pick-up in advance) or a private parcel service such as FedEx. As with eBay, you’re responsible for postage, tracking, and insurance, though you can pass these costs on to buyers at your discretion. DIY shipping makes more sense for Individual and low-volume Professional sellers, provided they have space to store and pack inventory.Fulfillment By Amazon Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) is a hands-off, turnkey approach that makes sense for high-volume professional sellers. With FBA, you simply need to send your items in bulk to your Amazon fulfillment center, either with Amazon’s discounted shipping service or via a private carrier. Amazon then stores your items, ships them when they’re purchased, and lets you keep track everything with a high-tech inventory management system. Most FBA orders qualify for free shipping when the customer’s order size is large enough, and Amazon Prime members can take advantage of expedited shipping options (such as overnight delivery) that you may not be equipped to offer. FBA even fulfills orders placed through non-Amazon websites (multi-channel fulfillment).Logistically, FBA takes a big weight off the shoulders of high-volume sellers, but there’s a downside: a slew of potential fees. Common FBA fees include monthly inventory storage fees ($0.54 per cubic foot from January through October, and $2.25 per cubic foot in November and December) and item removal (returned items cost $0.50 each, while disposal of unsellable items costs $0.15 each).Payment When your item sells, Amazon collects payment (typically by credit card or EFT) and deposits the seller’s payment into your seller account, less any sale or fulfillment fees. Amazon automatically cashes out seller accounts every 14 days, provided they have a balance of at least $1. You can request payouts to your personal or business bank account as often as every 24 hours, but Amazon reserves the right to hold some funds in your account to cover chargebacks and refunds as necessary. Transfers from your seller account to your bank account usually take three to five business days.Advantages of\\xa0AmazonGreater Trust in the Platform and Its Sellers. Amazon refers to itself as “a brand millions trust.” That’s no idle boast – as a huge company known for competitive prices and rapid shipping, Amazon has earned the\\xa0world’s trust and respect. Whereas\\xa0eBay sellers’ success is heavily determined by the quality and quantity of their ratings and reviews, Amazon buyers place their trust in the platform itself. This makes it easier for new, inexperienced Amazon sellers to gain a foothold on the platform – and to start making money on it.Fewer Scams. The public has good reason to trust Amazon: it’s highly secure. Since Amazon hosts all payment transactions, even those occurring between third-party buyers and sellers, the risk of fraud is much lower than on Craigslist. Additionally, sellers that use Amazon Fulfillment Services don’t have to worry about common buyer scams, such as fraudulent lost or damaged item claims.Growing Market. In contrast with eBay, which has seen anemic revenue growth and actual declines in visitor counts since its initial post-recession recovery, Amazon is posting consistent sales and traffic increases, month after month.\\xa0Though Amazon sellers are becoming more numerous, the pool of buyers is expanding, and individual buyers are spending more and more. More people and dollars on the platform mean more opportunities to sell – and, more likely than not, more money flowing into your pocket.You Can Sell From Home. You don’t have to meet Amazon buyers in person, so you can list your items and receive payment from the comfort of your own home. Even if you have to visit the post office to send packages, you don’t have to deal with the hassle of driving across town (or farther) to meet buyers.Disadvantages of\\xa0AmazonSome Product Categories Are Restricted. Sellers with Individual plans don’t have free reign on Amazon. Amazon requires sellers to obtain approval for items listed in certain categories, such as cosmetics, while other categories (including automotive) are exclusively available to Professional sellers. This incentivizes regular sellers to make the leap to Professional status, but is a potential hurdle for occasional sellers with no desire to go pro.Higher Fees. Amazon’s fees are generally higher than eBay’s, and definitely higher than Craigslist’s. This is the case even for low-volume individual sellers, who must pay $0.99 plus referral fees for every item they list. By contrast, eBay doesn’t have a listing fee for sellers who list fewer than 50 items per month.No Auction Option. Amazon doesn’t offer an auction-style sale option. This limits the financial upside on popular or hard-to-find items, as there’s no chance of a bidding war between motivated buyers.No Free Listing Option. If you’ve tried and failed to sell an item and simply want it gone, you can’t use Amazon for the digital equivalent of putting it on the curb. That’s a downside relative to Craigslist, whose ever-popular “free” option is a great way to get rid of junk you can’t store, sell, or give to the trash man.Bottom LineAmazon is a trusted intermediary that’s ideal for higher-volume sellers, especially those with multiple copies of the same product. Thanks to a streamlined transaction process and an awesome fulfillment system worthy of the world’s largest retailer, it’s easy to scale quickly with Amazon if and when you decide to transition from offloading unwanted stuff to earning real side income (or even quitting your job and earning a full-time income) as an online seller.AlternativesWhile eBay, Craigslist, and Amazon dominate the used item buying and selling market, there is an increasing number of alternatives:1. Local Facebook GroupsMany municipalities have one or more Facebook groups devoted to selling, trading, or bartering for items. Members can post photos, descriptions, and prices for unwanted items, allowing others to engage in discussions with sellers in the comments section.The association with Facebook may cut down on potential scams, since names, photos, and other identifying details are involved. It’s essentially the social media equivalent of miniature garage sales.2. ConsignmentThrift shore shopping has enjoyed a major resurgence over the last several years. While thrift stores often sell items that have been donated, consignment stores sell items on behalf of individuals.Consignment stores typically function according to two primary models:Purchase items from individuals outright, usually for somewhere between 10% and 50% of the estimated sale pricePay the consigner a percentage of the sale price – often close to 50% – if the item sells within a certain time-frame (typically 90 days)You usually receive a higher percentage of the sales price by working with a consignment store that operates using the second method – however, there’s no guarantee that you’ll get any money at all by going that route. If you don’t pick up your unsold items within a certain time-frame, the store will likely donate them.3. DonationWhile donating your unwanted items doesn’t directly put money in your pocket, it’s worthy of\\xa0consideration for several reasons:It’s Charitable. Find an organization that accepts donations on behalf of whichever cause is closest to your heart.It’s Simple. Many organizations place restrictions on the items they can accept for donation. For example, you can’t donate paint, chemicals, or large household appliances to most chapters of Goodwill. Still, it gratefully accepts a much wider variety of items – and a wider range of quality – than most buyers on Craigslist and eBay. In short, Goodwill is not picky. And some organizations, such as the Disabled American Veterans charity, even provides free curbside pick-up of items.It’s Tax Deductible. If you donate to a registered nonprofit 501c(3), there is a good chance you can write off the value of the donation on your annual tax return. Make sure to check with the organization to confirm this, and get a receipt – itemized if possible – for your tax records. If your donation is valued at $250 or more, you need written documentation from the recipient that you did not receive anything in exchange for it. If your donation is valued at more than $500, you may need to provide documentation (such as receipts) proving how you acquired the property in the first place. Check with a tax professional before making a donation valued at $500 or more.Final WordSelling used and unwanted items not only puts money in your pocket, but it’s also a very “green” environmental practice. When someone acquires a used item instead of purchasing new, they’ve reduced the carbon footprint inherent in sourcing, producing, and distributing an item. Plus, by giving an unwanted item a new home, you’re keeping it out of a landfill.The method you choose for selling or discarding your items is up to you, but make sure you put your personal safety above any potential monetary gain. Your life and health are worth more than the $20 you hope to get for that old blender.What other methods can you suggest to make money on used goods?Related68 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInRelated ArticlesWhy Downsizing Your Home Can Save You Money How To Stay Safe And Avoid Getting Ripped Off On Craigslist Reselling vs. Donating Unwanted Items for a Tax Deduction - What's Better?

When done correctly, you can use your credit cards specifically to get free vacations, cash back, and accumulate other rewards. This is known as churning. The churning process is not something that everyone can (nor should) try, but for those with the patience to plan and the ability to use their credit cards responsibly, there are significant benefits.Often, churners use multiple credit cards to accumulate rewards – in fact, some churners have dozens of credit cards active at any time, apply for multiple cards every year, and can even have multiple copies of the same card. By using numerous cards and qualifying for the often large bonuses they offer, churners can accumulate hundreds of thousands of airline miles, multiple weeks’ worth of free nights at hotels, and thousands of dollars in cash back bonuses.Using credit cards for free vacations or cash may sound too good to be true – and there are risks and potential pitfalls associated with the process. But while you may not\\xa0be able to churn your way to a vacation paid for in-full, churning is indeed a viable way to earn mostly-free benefits.Rewards Credit Cards and ProgramsChurning relies on credit cards which offer sign-up or usage bonuses (often both), such as cash back or airline points (miles). Numerous types of reward credit cards are available, but the types most likely to play a part in your churning strategy include cash back cards, airline miles cards, hotel rewards cards, and general rewards cards.The general goal of churning is to use credit cards that give the best possible rewards relative to your goals. For example, if you want to use rewards to take a vacation every year, airline rewards cards or hotel rewards credit cards may be ideal. However, if you want flexibility with your rewards, a cash back credit card or general rewards card could be preferable.With general rewards cards, you can use the points you earn for cash back, travel, merchandise, or other options .\\xa0For example, the Chase Ultimate Rewards program is one of the more popular programs for churners because of its flexibility. Each point you earn is worth $0.01, and you can use them in almost any way you like, such as redeeming for cash, or for flights on partner airlines, such as Korean Air and British Airways.Types of Rewards Credit CardsThere are two main types of rewards credit cards: bank-issued and co-branded.Bank-Issued Cards. When a bank issues a rewards credit card, the rewards typically come in the form of cash back. The issuing bank pays you the cash reward as a percentage of the purchases you made with the card (for example, an unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases). Many bank-issued cards also offer a one-time lump sum cash reward, or sign-up bonus. For example, let’s say you sign up for a reward card that gives a $100 cash back sign-up bonus after you use the card to make a purchase, and additionally provides a 2% reward on the value of any purchases make with the card. If you use the card to buy $2,000 worth of merchandise, you’ll receive $140 ($100 lump sum plus 2% of $2,000, or $40) as your reward.Co-branded Cards. Co-branded cards, on the other hand, come with rewards, such as free hotel nights or frequent flyer miles, that\\xa0are connected to a\\xa0retailer’s loyalty or rewards program, such as the AAdvantage program (American Airlines) or Hilton Hhonors (Hilton hotels). Co-branded cards confer miles or points based on purchase types and amounts (for example, 1 reward point per $1 spent on travel and dining purchases). They may also confer sign-up bonuses as a lump sum of miles or points, such as 50,000 points after making $2,000 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening.\\xa0In many situations you are\\xa0automatically enrolled in the loyalty program when you sign up for the card, but you can also use a preexisting account. (This is important if, for example, you have multiple rewards cards tied to the same reward program.)Bonuses and SpendsRegardless of whether a card is bank issues or co-branded, there are two key factors to look for when choosing your card:Sign-up Bonuses. Sign-up bonuses are points or rewards you receive for either signing up for a card and making a purchase or, more commonly, for signing up for a card and meeting a minimum spend.\\xa0A minimum spend is a required amount of money that you must spend on a card in order to receive the associated bonus or reward. Minimum spends usually have both a required spending amount and a time limit, but the requirements differ significantly between cards.\\xa0For example, you might\\xa0sign up for two cards: one that confers\\xa050,000 airline miles once you spend\\xa0$3,000\\xa0within the first 90 days of account opening,\\xa0and a second card with a $150 cash bonus upon making your first purchase.Annual Fees. Many rewards credit cards come with an annual fee. Annual fees range significantly, with $50 to $95 being common. However, fees of up to $500 are not unheard of for cards with large rewards and generous perks. (For example, the Delta Reserve Credit Card From American Express offers 10,000 Medallion Qualification Miles and 10,000 bonus miles, plus a host of travel benefits, but charges an annual fee of $495.) Credit card issuers sometimes waive annual fees for the first year, which enables savvy churners to cancel the card before the second year and avoid the annual fee.How to ChurnBefore you dive into churning, there is plenty of information you should\\xa0know. First, it’s essential\\xa0to pay off your balance in full every month to avoid interest charges, which negate the value of earned rewards, especially because rewards cards have higher-than-average interest rates.Basic StepsWhile you can develop a more complex churning strategy, you’ll always use these basics as the foundation of your plan:Apply for a credit cardMeet the minimum spend requirements to receive the sign-up bonusUse the rewardsCancel the card before the annual fee comes dueRepeatNecessary\\xa0InformationBefore you apply for any rewards credit card, assess some key information regarding your spending habits and financial situation:How Much Do You Spend Per Month? Your ability to obtain maximum rewards depends on how much you spend. Most importantly, you must be able to\\xa0meet the minimum spend to get the big sign-up bonuses that make churning worthwhile.How Much\\xa0Can You Pay\\xa0For With a Credit Card?\\xa0Once you’ve figured your monthly spend amount, determine how much of it can be paid for with credit cards as opposed to debit, check, or cash.What Is Your Credit Score? There are many ways to find out your credit score. Regardless of the method, you’ll want a credit score of at least 700, and preferably 750 or higher, to qualify for the most valuable rewards cards.Which Cards Meet Your Spending Ability? Once you know your credit score and how much you spend, you can determine which cards fit your spending abilities. For example, if you have excellent credit and can spend $1,200 per month on a card, you can probably\\xa0qualify\\xa0for a single card, such as the Capital One Venture Card,\\xa0and meet the minimum spend requirement to get the sign-up bonus. If the amount you spend is higher, you can consider a multiple-card churning strategy.Churning a\\xa0Single CardFor many people, the\\xa0simplest way to churn credit card rewards is to use a single card at a time. While this method may not provide you with a free vacation every year, it is a strategy you can use if you don’t think you can meet multiple minimum spend requirements, aren’t comfortable with opening multiple credit card accounts at any one time, or are simply curious about the process and want to try it out.Here are the steps you should take if you want to churn a single rewards card:Research Current Card Offers. Offers come and go, so you need to look for the offers that fit your needs and goals (such as airline or hotel points).Apply for the Card. Fill out the necessary paperwork or apply online.Meet the Minimum Spend. The clock usually starts ticking on your minimum spend requirements the day you’re approved for your card. So, if you receive your card 5 days after approval and have 90 days to meet the spend, you effectively only have 85 days.Use the Rewards. Once you’ve made the minimum spend, it usually takes some time (30 to 60 days) before your rewards account is credited with the minimum spend card bonus. Once you have the bonus, you can use it as you like.Cancel, Downgrade, or Keep. If your card has an annual fee, or an annual fee that is waived the first year, you may want to cancel the card before the fee comes due. If you want to keep the card, you might be able to downgrade it to a no-fee version. In some situations, the annual fee is\\xa0less than the value of the rewards offered, such as a free hotel night each year.\\xa0In these situations, you may opt to keep the card and pay the annual fee. To cancel or downgrade, you need to call the issuer.Repeat. Whether you cancel or keep your single card, you can repeat the process as often as you like, with some limitations. For example, if you think you can meet a minimum spend requirement every three months, you can sign up for a new rewards card (with a sign-up bonus) every three months. However, some card companies have restrictions on how often you can apply for a card. For example, according to Doctor of Credit, Chase limits applicants to five co-branded cards per 24 months.Churning Strategies for Multiple CardsWhile signing up for, using, and keeping track of multiple rewards cards at any time can be a challenge, the potential rewards are significant. Experienced churners who use multiple cards use a variety of strategies that\\xa0single-card churners may not use:Decide on a Goal, Research Your Options, and Develop a Plan.\\xa0When you churn multiple credit cards, it can be tempting to go after the best offers no matter what. However, this isn’t always the best way to churn. Before you start, it’s essential to set a goal and develop a plan that allows you to achieve it. For example, if you want to plan a seven-day vacation, you must identify how many airline rewards points you need for your flight, and how many hotel points you need for accommodations. Once you know, you can set a schedule of when you need to apply for the cards, how much you need to spend on each, and when you need to cancel or downgrade cards to avoid the annual fee. Keeping all this information, as well as links to account pages and access details, on a spreadsheet is the easiest way to account for everything.Review\\xa0Your Credit Reports. Whenever you apply for credit, that application affects your credit report – even if you are rejected. To evaluate your loan application, the potential creditor checks your credit report (known as a “hard pull”), which creates a small negative impact on your credit score. The hard pull is recorded on your credit report for two years, after which time it is removed.\\xa0Though each hard pull lowers your credit score slightly, multiple applications submitted in short succession can give creditors pause and lead to your card applications being denied, even if your score is otherwise good. As a general rule, churners use a 91-day credit application guide. You should not try to apply for any form of credit within 90 days after your last hard pull shows up on your credit report. This shows a creditor that you are not applying for too many loans at any time.Match Current Card Offers to Your Abilities.\\xa0Let’s say you can use your credit cards for $6,000 in purchases within the next three months. In this case, look for cards that match these limits and fit your churning goal. If you are planning to churn cards for a vacation, you could\\xa0apply for two airlines cards, each with a 50,000-mile bonus that requires a $3,000 minimum spend within 90 days. Alternatively, you might apply for one of the airline cards plus two hotel cards that confer a bonus worth three hotel nights and each requires a $1,500 spend in the same time period.Use an App-O-Rama. An App-O-Rama, commonly referred to as an AOR, is a single day in which you apply for multiple credit cards. The main reason churners use an AOR is to lessen the chances of each card company seeing the hard pulls from the other card applications, as they don’t appear on your credit report immediately. If instead, you spread out your applications over several days or more, your credit reports will likely show the previous applications, and the card issuers are\\xa0more likely to reject you.Review Your Follow-Up Emails and Have Reconsideration Lines Researched. When you use an AOR,\\xa0you should receive an email response from each application fairly quickly, usually within an hour or so, but often within minutes. The response is one of two general types: either “Congratulations! You’re accepted!” or, “Thank you for applying, we’ll contact you later.” If you receive the second, it\\xa0almost always means you’ve been rejected. A rejection can put a serious dent in your churning plans, so you’ll need to be prepared to act. Since not all credit card rejections are final, call the issuer and see if more information is needed for approval. For example, a card company\\xa0may need\\xa0your income history, which\\xa0you can provide over the phone to the representative, who can then streamline approval.Track Your Spending and Switch Cards.\\xa0Once you’ve received your cards, start using them. There’s no one way to use cards, but most churners use one card at a time until they reach the minimum spend, then move on to the next. Alternatively, if you’re using rewards cards that offer different reward values for different categories, such as triple points for restaurants or higher cash back percentages for groceries, use each card for the more valuable rewards.Schedule Card Payment Times. If you have multiple credit card accounts open and in use at any time, you have to be certain that you pay them all in full and on time. One strategy that churners use is to schedule payment due dates on the same day each month, as it can make paying on time logistically easier. Most credit card companies allow you to schedule your payment due date online.Use Rewards, Cancel Cards, and Repeat.\\xa0Once you’ve obtained bonuses, use the rewards to book flights, hotels, or withdraw cash (or apply it to pay off your balance). Also, keep track of annual fee due dates, and cancel or downgrade cards with fees that are soon to accrue. Once you’ve mastered the process, you can repeat it as necessary and continue to earn rewards bonuses indefinitely.Expert Churning StrategiesThere are a variety of strategies that churners use that go beyond using credit cards to make day-to-day or common purchases.1. Bill PaySometimes you can use credit cards to pay for bills that you might not have previously considered. Whether it’s your rent, utilities, or student loans,\\xa0check with the company to see if paying by credit card is accepted.Be aware though that when you use a credit card to pay some bills, there might be a fee. For example, the IRS allows you to pay your tax bills using credit cards, but only through approved third-party payment processors. These processors charge fees of between 1.87% and 2.25% of the total taxes you pay on your card. To determine if it’s worthwhile to use the card to make the payment, look at the value of the rewards earned vs. the cost of the payment service.Let’s say you have a cash rewards card that gives you 2% cash back on any purchases, and you pay your taxes through a provider that charges 1.8%. The cash back rewards allows you to make a small amount (0.2%) of cash back when you pay your tax bill.Or, say you have an airline rewards card that gives 60,000 miles on a $3,000 minimum spend. The 60,000 miles allows you to book two domestic round-trip coach class tickets on the airline. If you pay a $3,000 dollar tax bill on the card, you meet the minimum spend and pay 1.8% as a payment processing fee, or $54 dollars. This way you effectively pay\\xa0$54 for two airline tickets.2. Double-DippingA double- (or triple- or quadruple-) dip is what happens when you use a single transaction to receive multiple rewards from different programs. For example, say you have a credit card that gives 2% cash back on general purchases, and 4% on any grocery purchases. Your local grocery store runs a promotion selling gift cards specific to the store at 10% off. If you use your credit card to buy a gift card and use the card to buy your groceries, you are effectively getting a 14% discount on any groceries you buy at that store.3. Manufactured SpendingExperienced churners don’t simply use their credit cards to pay for purchases, bills, or other expenses – they use their cards to make purchases without actually buying anything. This is known as manufactured spending. Most manufactured spending techniques allow you accumulate miles or rewards by making purchases that you later turn into cash.There is a wide variety of strategies that churners use to manufacture spending. Some are fee-free, while others have small or minimal fees. Many manufactured spending opportunities come and go, so what worked in the past may not work for you. Serious churners are constantly researching new ways to manufacture spends.Examples include:Gift Cards. Buying gift cards is one of the more popular manufactured spending methods. Many retailers sell generic gift cards, such as Visa or American Express branded cards. While these cards come with an activation fee, typically in the $3 to $5 range, that fee is usually offset when you use a cash back rewards card to buy the gift card. (For example, if you buy a $500 gift card that has a $5 activation fee, but use the rewards card that gives you 2% back, you get $10 back on your purchase price, or $5 more than the five-dollar fee required to buy the card.) Once you have the card, you then have to turn the money on the card into cash. Some banks allow you to pay your credit card bills with a gift card, making the process fairly straightforward. In other situations, you might be able to use your gift card to purchase money orders, which can then be deposited into your checking account.Bank Account Funding. When you open an account with a new bank, it might allow you to fund your account with a credit card. While this is typically a one-time-only opportunity available when you open the account, it’s an easy way to effectively transfer money from your credit card to your bank account without losing any money.Microloans. Some churner use microloans as a way to manufacture spending. Microloans, or peer-to-peer loans, are small loans that individuals can give to people, typically in developing economies, through a variety of microloan websites, such as Kiva or Prosper. When you give a microloan, the borrower is expected to pay the money back over time. By using a credit card, you can give out low-risk microloans, and can even earn interest. Once paid back, you can then loan that same amount of money again, repeating the process indefinitely. However, note that “low risk” is not “no risk” – it is possible that the money you loan might not be repaid. Furthermore, microloan repayments take months, so you cannot count on getting that money back immediately.Additional Reward Program BenefitsIn addition to travel rewards or cash back, there are other perks and benefits that apply to some – though not all – rewards cards. Consider these potential benefits before deciding which rewards card (or cards) to apply for.1. Point Transfers Between Loyalty ProgramsSome rewards cards allow you to transfer earned points to other rewards programs. For example, by using a rewards credit card that earns Hilton Honors points – such as the Citi Hilton Honors Visa Signature Card – you can earn free or discounted stays at Hilton-branded hotels – but, according to Hilton Honors, you can also transfer rewards points to miles or points in rewards programs from Amtrak, Virgin Atlantic, and Hawaiian Airlines.Each rewards card or rewards program determines exactly how you can transfer the points you have earned. For example, if you have 30,000 Hilton Honors points, you can transfer these points to Amtrak for 15,000 Amtrak Guest Rewards Points, or to Hawaiian Airlines for 20,000 HawaiianMiles. Other cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred, allow 1-to-1 point transfers to partner rewards programs. Therefore, if you have 30,000 Chase points, you can transfer these for 30,000 IHG Rewards Club or Southwest Rapid Rewards points, among other participating partner programs.2. Points PurchasesMany rewards programs allow you to purchase points or miles directly, such as 1,000 points for $0.01 per point ($10 total). Also, rewards programs or rewards card issuers may offer special deals on point purchases, such as 10,000 points for $50, discounted from a normal price of $100. Points purchases can be useful when you only need a small number of points to reach a reward level or specific perk.3. Travel and Purchase PerksMany rewards credit cards come with travel and purchase perks that can be useful to churners:Travel/Trip Insurance. Some credit cards offer travel insurance if you use the card to pay for a trip. Though the type and amount of coverage differs significantly between cards, travel insurance can cover the cost of lost baggage, property lost to hotel theft, medical or travel accident expenses, trip cancellation, and even death or dismemberment.Rental Car Insurance. Some cards offer theft or collision insurance when you use your card to rent a car, though you may have to waive the rental company’s insurance to receive this benefit.Extended Warranties. If your card offers an extended warranty perk, the issuer extends the warranty of any item purchased with the card, sometimes for twice the length of the original warranty.Price Matching/Price Protection. A price matching or price protection benefit allows you to use your card to make a purchase and recover the price difference if you later find the item advertised at a lower price. For example, if you use your card to buy a printer for $500 but later find it for sale for $400, the issuer will reimburse you the $100 difference. Price protection perks often require you to apply for the reimbursement by sending the card company appropriate evidence. There are also time limits for reimbursement (such as 90 days after purchase), as well as a cap on the amount, such as up to $2,000 per year for all reimbursements.No Foreign Transaction Fees. Many cards charge a percentage of each foreign transaction – but a card with no foreign transaction fees does not. While rewards cards are more likely to charge foreign transaction fees than non-rewards cards, some – such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred card – waive such fees.Reward Program LimitationsMany of these limitations are expressly listed in the card agreements – but others may not be. It is best to contact the card issuer if you have any questions or doubts.1. Common Rewards\\xa0RestrictionsRestrictions that apply to rewards or rewards programs differ from card to card, and are included in the “terms and conditions” of each reward point program. These restrictions typically come in several common forms:Expiration Dates. Rewards points can expire, but the expiration timelines differ widely. Some rewards programs allow points to remain active for as long as your account is open; others require you to use at least some of the rewards within 12 months of receiving them. Still, some others apply a specific time limit, such as three years, after which rewards expire.Blackout Dates. Airfare and hotel rewards can come with blackout dates or other restrictions regarding when you can use your rewards. For example, an airline rewards program might not allow you to purchase tickets using points during peak travel times, such as at Thanksgiving or Christmas.Peak Travel Costs. Airlines often have different point requirements for frequent flyer tickets based both on seat class (coach, business, or first) and the time of travel. For example, a round-trip international coach class tickets to Europe from the United States may cost 40,000 miles during off-peak travel (non-summer) months, and 60,000 miles during peak travel time.Seat Restrictions. Airlines can restrict rewards point travelers by limiting the number of rewards seats available per flight. For example, a flight may have a small, predetermined number of seats available to people who use rewards miles to obtain their tickets. So even if there is a flight that is not fully booked and you have enough points to cover the cost of a ticket, you may not be able to book a seat.Minimum Redemption Requirements. Some cards have minimum redemption requirements, thresholds you must meet before qualifying to cash in or use rewards. For example, the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express has a $25 minimum redemption requirement, meaning you have to earn $25 in rewards before you can use them. If you earn only $20 in rewards, you cannot redeem them.2. Travel Fees and TaxesIf you churn travel rewards cards, a paid-for vacation is the goal, but not typically the reality, as there can be travel-related expenses not completely covered by rewards points.For example, you may use your airline miles to purchase a pair of tickets from the United States to Europe, and use your hotel points to book a week of hotel rooms. However, according to The New York Times, taxes and fees for an international flight can exceed $150 per person, and such expenses may not be covered by frequent flyer miles.3. Income Taxes on Reward ValueIn general, the IRS does not consider credit card rewards income; it considers them discounts. You do not have to report credit card rewards as income, nor do you have to pay income taxes on the rewards you acquire or use.However, there are some exceptions to this general rule:If you use your business credit card to obtain rewards, you can only deduct expenses after subtracting the value of the reward.If your credit card rewards exceed $600 for any specific calendar year, your credit card issuer can choose to report those rewards to the IRS using a form 1099-MISC. If it does so, the company also sends you a copy of the 1099 form, which means you have to report this income to the IRS when you file your taxes, and pay taxes on the value of the reward.If you receive a gift bonus instead of a reward on spending, the value of the gift is taxable. For example, if you sign up for a bank account and receive a $500 bonus just for signing up, the IRS considers that bonus income. On the other hand, if you have to spend $5,000 on a credit card to receive a $500 bonus, the bonus is considered a discount, and you won’t have to pay taxes on it.Tax issues for credit card rewards can change at any time. Speak to a tax professional about any concerns you have, especially if you plan to churn regularly or have accumulated a significant amount of credit card rewards in the past year.4. DevaluationsRewards points devaluations are a significant issue for churners, especially if they catch you unaware. A devaluation is when a company increases the amount of points necessary to redeem any specific reward. Devaluations typically don’t reduce the number of points you have earned, but rather change how valuable those points are.Let’s say you’ve earned 75,000 hotel rewards points and want to use them for an upcoming five-night vacation not yet booked. The hotel chain requires 15,000 points per night to stay at a Class B hotel, and 25,000 to stay at Class A. So, you plan to use your points to stay five nights in a Class B, meaning your hotel expenses are covered.But before you book, the company changes its rewards structure so a night in a Class B hotel requires 20,000. While you still have 75,000 points, the devaluation means you can only use your points for three nights in a Class B (60,000 points). If you still want a five-night vacation, you won’t be able to cover all your hotel nights with points alone.When to Consider ChurningIf you are capable of using credit responsibly, churning can be rewarding. If all or most of the following statements apply to you, ]it may be a worthwhile pursuit.1. You Already Use Credit Cards FrequentlySome people don’t like using cash or writing checks, and find that the convenience of using a credit card outweighs any other payment option. If you already regularly use credit cards, your ability to churn effectively is greater than those who are reluctant to use plastic.2. You Never Carry a Credit Card BalanceRegularly using a credit card is a great way to rack up reward points. But if you carry a balance, rewards points are unlikely to significantly offset the finance charges you’ll incur (especially because rewards credit cards typically have higher interest rates).3. You Credit Score Is ExcellentIf your credit score is solid, you should be able to acquire numerous credit cards at any time. Keep in mind, the temporary credit hit you’ll take from a hard pull on your credit report only minimally reduces your score and is off your report after two years.4. You Are Financially Stable and ResponsibleAnytime you use credit or consider taking on debt, you need to be honest with yourself regarding your financial stability and responsibility. If you have a regular source of income, do not spend beyond your means, always pay your bills, and are able to save money regularly, you may be a good candidate for churning.5. You Own Your Own BusinessThe average consumer uses credit cards to make day-to-day purchases such as gas, groceries, or gifts. These expenses aren’t always enough for\\xa0significant rewards points, nor do they often\\xa0allow people to meet the minimum spend required on more than two cards at a time. The average consumer may not be able to churn multiple cards effectively because they simply don’t spend enough.But\\xa0if you are a small business owner, the amount of money you charge on a business credit card may be much greater then the expenses you charge on a personal card. If you take out credit cards for both personal and business use, you can greatly increase the number of cards you have, as well as the amount of rewards you receive.6. You Have a Goal and Can Create a Plan to Reach ItThe process of planning a vacation paid for entirely with rewards points takes a lot of time and attention to detail. If you want to use churning to pay for vacations every year or to get as much cash back as possible, you need to research and develop a detailed plan that fits your individual goals. Credit card rewards programs constantly change, and companies issue new credit cards on a regular basis. A good churner is aware of these changes and can adjust his or her strategy to take advantage of the best offers at any given time.When to Avoid ChurningSome people are not well-suited to churning. If any of the following apply to you, you should not churn.1. You Don’t Have a Reliable Income or Can’t Pay Your BillsIf you do not have a stable income or have difficulty paying your bills, churning is probably not for you. While a cash back rewards card might give you some money back, missing a couple of payments or keeping a balance on your card costs a lot more in the long run. Not only that, but if you don’t have a regular income, it’s doubtful you’ll qualify for the best rewards cards available.2. You Don’t Pay Your Credit Card Balances in Full Every MonthWhenever you carry a balance on a credit card, the issuer charges interest that can easily exceed the value of any rewards you receive. If you keep a balance on your credit cards, churning is not for you.3. You Don’t Have a Good Credit ScoreWhen you apply for a credit card, the hard pull on your credit report affects your credit score – and when you apply for multiple cards, your score lowers slightly for at least several months. Furthermore, if you are approved for multiple cards, it lowers the average length of time you’ve had each line of credit, which could also lower your score. If you already have a relatively low score, this could cause more damage, making further lines of credit unobtainable.4. You Frequently OverspendIf you are prone to making impulse purchases, spending beyond your means, or buying things simply to receive credit card rewards, churning is not a good idea. Spending money that you cannot afford to spend (or which would be better saved) always costs you more than the worth of credit card rewards.5. You Can’t Meet Minimum Spend RequirementsIf you sign up for a card and are unable to meet the minimum spend requirement, you’ve effectively wasted the opportunity to take advantage of the rewards offered by that card. If you can’t meet minimum spends, you are better off with a low-APR credit card or one that gives a cash back bonus without a minimum spend requirement.6. You Plan to Apply for a Car Loan or Mortgage SoonKeep in mind that applying for or opening numerous credit card accounts can lower your credit score. If you are planning to take out a car loan or mortgage anytime soon, a lower credit score means you may pay a higher interest rate. Avoid churning if you plan to borrow money to purchase a car or a house in the near future.7. You Don’t Keep Track of Important DatesOne of the most important parts of churning is knowing when your credit card annual fees are due, and canceling or downgrading those cards before that fee accrues. Done properly, this strategy allows you to use credit cards with potentially high annual fees without ever having to pay those fees. If you cannot keep track of when to cancel or downgrade cards, the amount you pay in annual fees could greatly exceed the value of the rewards you receive.Final WordAdvanced churners spend a lot of time researching, reading, and talking with other churners about how to make the most of their credit card spending and rewards. New opportunities, risks, and changes arise regularly, and keeping yourself educated is essential to ensure that you get the best deal possible with every rewards credit card you sign up for.Have you tried to churn rewards?

By matching\\xa0individual borrowers with individual or institutional investors willing to lend funds at competitive interest rates, Prosper cuts out the middle man (traditional banks or credit unions). Relative to those institutions, Prosper has more relaxed approval standards and faster funding times for borrowers.The platform\\xa0earns money through origination and servicing fees. Its top competitors include other P2P lenders, such as Lending Club and Peerform, and low-cost personal credit providers such as\\xa0Avant, which doesn’t use the P2P model and thus isn’t available to prospective lenders.If you’re looking for an unsecured personal loan on Prosper, you can find one as small as $2,000 or as large as $35,000. You can expect to pay an interest rate of about 5.99% to about 35.97% APR, depending on your credit score, credit history, and past borrowing record on Prosper. Though Prosper’s interest rates aren’t tied to Libor or another index, the company warns borrowers that its rates may rise or fall in accordance with prevailing market conditions.How It Works for InvestorsFor investors, Prosper’s most popular offering is Notes, or shares of individual loans with a value of $25 and up\\xa0– which is also Prosper’s minimum investment amount.\\xa0Notes are\\xa0shares in loans that haven’t yet originated, not already-funded loans. Some Prosper\\xa0loans don’t receive enough funding to originate. But if you reserve Notes in a loan that doesn’t originate, you don’t lose the amount you put towards that loan. Instead, Prosper returns your funds and lets you allocate them to\\xa0other loans’ Notes.With a low\\xa0investment threshold of $25 per loan, investors can create a\\xa0diversified loan portfolio with a relatively modest initial investment. If you invest the minimum in each note, a $2,500 investment gives you access to 100 individual loans. Loan performance\\xa0ranges widely, but diversified loan portfolios (100 or more loans) typically produce average annual returns of between 7% and 9%, though that figure is subject to change and past performance isn’t predictive of future results.\\xa0Prosper also allows investors to fund loans in their entirety, a more common option for institutional and accredited investors.Prosper isn’t\\xa0perfect. Though the platform\\xa0carefully vets its borrowers, some may default on their obligations. Borrowers’ origination fees and other expenses may add to the total cost of a loan as well. And since their\\xa0funds aren’t FDIC-insured,\\xa0Prosper investors risk loss of principal. As with any big financial decision, it’s important to understand all the risks associated with lending or borrowing through Prosper’s platform.Selecting Loans and InvestingProsper lets you browse its loan listings and manually invest $25 or more in individual loans that appeal to you. You can filter listings by the borrower’s Prosper Rating, loan purpose, principal amount, time left in listing, yield, amount funded, and other criteria. It’s important to note that loans with higher yields – issued to borrowers with lower credit scores and Prosper Ratings – present a greater risk of failure than loans with lower yields.If a loan that you’ve placed a bid on is funded, the money will drop out of your account within one business day. Note that\\xa0Prosper assesses\\xa0an annual service fee of 1% of each\\xa0loan’s current outstanding principal. It passes this cost on to investors, so your yield is always a percentage point lower than the rate paid by the borrower. Prosper’s service fee is identical to service fees charged by Lending Club and Peerform, its principal competitors.Before investing in a loan, use Prosper’s information-dense listings\\xa0to determine whether it meets your standards. Listings include high-level information about the loan, such as the principal size, term, borrower rating, yield for lender, and rate for borrower. It also shows the loan’s estimated default risk (based on the borrower’s Prosper Rating), which is important for your risk calculations. They also include information about the borrower’s credit profile (visible only to registered Prosper investors), a self-description of the borrower, and a summary of the loan’s purpose.Quick InvestProsper’s Quick Invest tool makes it less time-consuming to invest in loans that meet your standards, allowing you to quickly build a diversified portfolio. Quick Invest automatically screens loans using any\\xa0listing criteria you desire, shows you the pool of all qualifying loans for approval, and\\xa0bids\\xa0a specified dollar amount in each once you confirm the order.If you want more control over the process, you can manually screen each loan that meets your Quick Invest criteria. If you want less control, you can automate the Quick Invest process, allowing it to place bids without asking for confirmation.Receiving FundsAll Prosper loans\\xa0throw off monthly payments that can arrive in your Prosper account at any time of the month, typically on the numerical day of the loan’s initial funding. As a lender, you receive a slice of the borrower’s monthly payment proportional to your total ownership of his or her\\xa0loan.For instance, if you own Notes equivalent to\\xa05% of a loan with a monthly payment (less the service fee) of $200, you’ll receive $10 each month.\\xa0If a borrower is late on a payment, you receive a proportional slice of his or her late fee for that month. You can withdraw funds from your Prosper account to your bank account or reinvest them in new loans at any time, provided you’ve reached the minimum cash-out or investment threshold ($25).EligibilityProsper is available to lenders most U.S. states plus the District of Columbia. Lending is partially restricted in some places: In\\xa0Alaska, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Washington State, lenders must have either a gross annual income of $70,000 and a net worth of $70,000, or a net worth of $250,000. Lenders who live in these states also can’t invest more than 10% of their net worth\\xa0with Prosper.\\xa0In California, the 10% net worth rule also applies, and lenders must have at least $85,000 in gross income or at least $200,000 in net worth. These restrictions are subject to change, so check with Prosper for up-to-date information.ApplicationTo set up your Prosper account, you need to provide current contact information\\xa0and your Social Security number. You also need to provide a bank account and routing number so that you can\\xa0deposit and withdraw funds from your Prosper account.It can take up to three business days for Prosper to verify your bank account. Once this occurs, you can make an\\xa0initial deposit of $25 or more and begin investing. You must have enough money in your Prosper account to cover any bids you make.How It Works for BorrowersHere’s what you need to know before you borrow from Prosper.Loan Characteristics and RestrictionsUsing your Prosper Rating and requested term length, Prosper\\xa0sets an interest rate and principal amount for the loan. 60-month loans tend to have higher rates. Borrower rates range from about 6.99% APR to about 36% APR, with rates for borrowers with good or excellent credit coming in between 7% and\\xa015% APR – competitive with personal loan rates at traditional banks, which typically start in the 7% to 8% APR range. Rates for borrowers with mediocre credit may be equivalent to or even higher than credit card APRs available to candidates with similar scores.Prosper also charges an origination fee of between 1% and 5%, depending on your Prosper Rating and loan term. For instance, a borrower with an A rating pays an origination fee of 4% on a 36-month loan. This amount is added to the principal, so a $10,000, 36-month loan would carry an origination fee of $400 for an A-rated borrower.Your loan’s principal amount is\\xa0usually the\\xa0amount you request. However, it could be lower if your Prosper Rating doesn’t qualify you for a higher principal amount. Upper borrowing limits are $30,000 for borrowers rated C, $25,000 for borrowers rated D, $10,000 for borrowers rated E, and $4,000 for borrowers rated HR. And if you’re rated AA, you\\xa0can’t get a 60-month loan of more than $20,000. A and B borrowers are eligible for all loan terms and sizes. These restrictions are subject to change, so check back with Prosper before applying.Verification, Approval, and FundingAs soon as Prosper sets your Prosper Rating, interest rate, loan term, and principal amount, your listing appears in its\\xa0database. This enables\\xa0investors to bid on Notes to fund your loan. If you don’t receive bids equal to at least 70% of your requested loan amount (Prosper’s threshold for partial loan funding) within 14 days, your listing will\\xa0expire.Once your loan crosses the partial funding threshold,\\xa0Prosper begins its pre-loan review. During this period,\\xa0Prosper thoroughly assesses your risk profile, verifying additional information such as\\xa0employment status, annual income, homeowner status, past judgments and liens, and ongoing obligations (such as child or spousal support). This\\xa0process can take between two and eight business days, with self-employed applicants tending towards the longer end. You need to repeat this process, including the credit check, for each Prosper loan.When\\xa0the pre-loan review\\xa0process is complete, your application is officially approved\\xa0and you receive funding\\xa0within two business days. Partially funded loans originate in the funding amount they receive – a $10,000 loan request that receives 80% funding originates as an $8,000 loan. If you don’t make it through the verification process for any reason (for instance, if Prosper can’t verify your income or\\xa0employment), you won’t receive any funds, and any investors who bid on your Notes will keep their money.RepaymentFor all disbursed loans, Prosper charges an origination\\xa0fee between 1% and 5%, depending on Prosper Rating. This amount is deducted from your loan principal, so even a fully funded loan can be up to 5% smaller\\xa0than the requested amount. The origination fee is part of the\\xa0principal and accrues interest over the loan’s term.Once issued, you repay your loan monthly via an automatic debit from your provided bank account. Your monthly payment, which depends on the\\xa0loan’s size, rate, and origination fee, stays the same over the life of the loan. However, you can make manual, one-time payments in any amount or pay off your loan in full at any time before maturity.If you’re more than 15 days late on a payment, you’re charged a late fee equivalent to the greater of $15 or 5% of the unpaid installment amount. If you’re more than 30 days late on a payment due to insufficient funds in your linked\\xa0account, Prosper may refer you to a collection agency. Borrowers who become delinquent may find it harder to get future Prosper loans, though there’s no automatic disqualification.EligibilityProsper doesn’t reveal all the details about how it approves loan applications, but first-time applicants generally need a credit score of at least 600. Having a higher credit score, lower debt-to-income ratio, and steady employment and income all increase your likelihood of approval.\\xa0Standards are a little more lenient for borrowers who successfully pay off their first Prosper loan; second-time applicants may be approved with a score as low as 600.\\xa0Prosper is available to borrowers in all U.S. states except Maine, Iowa, and North Dakota, each of which has laws\\xa0prohibiting P2P lending.ApplicationTo place your application, you need to provide some basic information about yourself and your loan: how much you want to borrow, what the loan is for, your credit quality on a scale from “poor” (below 640) to “excellent” (above 760), your current address, and your driver’s license number. You must also provide information for the bank account you’ll use to repay your loan.Prosper then\\xa0verifies your identity and pulls your credit score and report from one or more of the three major consumer credit reporting bureaus. Using this information, Prosper estimates\\xa0the likelihood that you’ll default on your loan in a 12-month period. It translates this likelihood into your Prosper Rating, which ranges from high-quality AA (estimated annual default rate of less than 2%), through A, B, C, D, and E, to low-quality HR (estimated annual default rate above 15%).Key FeaturesProsper has some additional features worth noting:Retirement AccountsProsper investors\\xa0can set up a traditional or Roth IRA\\xa0and use it to buy and sell Notes or fund loans in their entirety (though the second option may be impractical for larger loans due to annual contribution limits for IRAs).Multiple Loans Outstanding for BorrowersAs a Prosper borrower, you can have up to two\\xa0outstanding loans at once, provided you don’t exceed $35,000 in outstanding principal at any time. You must wait at least six months from your last loan origination and have at least six months of consecutive on-time payments to apply for a second loan.Customer SupportProsper’s borrower support team is available from 8am to 9pm Eastern, Monday through Friday. Its investor support team is available from 8am to 6pm Eastern, Monday through Friday. Saturday hours are shorter. There’s also an email support line that typically produces responses within one to two business days.Advantages1. Low Minimum Investment RequirementsFor investors, Prosper accounts require a minimum opening deposit of $25. That’s also the minimum amount you can invest in a loan. Some competing platforms require investors to be accredited, substantially impairing access. With a minimum annual income requirement of $200,000 ($300,000 for a married couple), accreditation is out of reach for most people.2. Extremely Fast\\xa0FundingProsper’s popularity with investors leads to very fast funding for most listings, even those with lower Prosper Ratings. Many listings are fully funded within minutes of appearing – well before the 14-day expiration date. This doesn’t impact Prosper’s verification and approval process, so fully funded listings don’t guarantee that a loan will actually be made. But fast funding definitely removes some uncertainty for borrowers.By contrast, Peerform has fewer\\xa0investors, meaning\\xa0its loans may not be funded as quickly (or at all). Lending Club has a more onerous funding process that can stretch on for weeks.3. You Can Borrow Up to $35,000Depending on your Prosper Rating and loan term, Prosper allows you to borrow up to $35,000 in a single loan. By contrast, Avant, a noted competitor, limits individual loans to $20,000 for all borrowers.4. Diversified Portfolios Have an Excellent Track Record on ProsperWhile it’s important to note that past performance doesn’t predict future results, Prosper proudly touts its investors’ perfect track record of positive returns on diversified portfolios. Since Prosper relaunched its site in mid-2009 (after a closure in the wake of the financial crisis), every single portfolio with exposure to more than 100 individual loans has produced a positive annual return for its owner. With Notes starting at $25, this performance is achievable with an investment of $2,500 or more.By contrast, Lending Club can’t tout a perfect track record on diversified portfolios. About 0.1% of Lending Club portfolios with exposure to more than 100 loans have produced negative annual returns at some point – not a huge number, but\\xa0not negligible either.5. No Need to Invest in Multiples of $25Prosper allows you to\\xa0make investments of any amount above $25 – $45, $74, $1,010, whatever. Lending Club\\xa0is less flexible, requiring investments in increments of $25 – $50, $75, $1,000, and so on.Disadvantages1. Strict Credit Requirements for BorrowersProsper doesn’t approve loan applications from first-time borrowers with credit scores below 640, regardless of other factors such as income, employment, homeownership status, and current credit utilization. This may arbitrarily shut out some borrowers\\xa0who would be likely to stay current on their loan payments – impacting borrowers’ access to credit, as well as the range of choices available to investors willing to accept the risk of lending to people with lower credit scores.By contrast,\\xa0Peerform accepts borrowers with credit scores as low as 600, provided that they have steady incomes, low credit usage, and other indicators of financial stability.2. Geographical Restrictions for ParticipantsDue to legal restrictions, Prosper isn’t available to everyone. The platform accepts borrower applications from all but a handful of states, but investor applications are dicier – just 31 states, plus the District of Columbia, participate at last check. Investors’ participation is further restricted in several of the states where\\xa0P2P lending is legal.Since it’s restricted to accredited investors only, Peerform’s row is less legally onerous to hoe. It’s available to investors in all 50 states, provided they meet the income and asset qualifications.3. Higher Origination Fees for Some LoansProsper may have higher origination fees than some competitors. For instance, on loans to borrowers\\xa0rated A, Prosper charges a 3.95% fee. At Lending Club, fees for borrowers with a similar risk profile range between 1% and 3%. Meanwhile, borrowers rated C and below pay 4.95% at Prosper.4. Relatively High Default RatesFor investors, Prosper may pose a higher risk of principal loss. Since its relaunch in 2009, annual loss rates on its 36-month loans have been mostly\\xa0higher than Lending Club’s. 2011 and 2012 were the worst years, with Prosper’s loss rates about 4% higher than Lending Club’s. The one exception is 2009, when its loss rates were about 0.5% lower than Lending Club’s. However,\\xa0Prosper was offline for part of that year, making an apples to apples comparison tricky.5.\\xa0Unsecured Personal Loans Only Prosper only offers one type of credit product: unsecured personal loans. In addition to unsecured personal loans, Lending Club offers business loans of up to $300,000 with rates starting around 5.9%, plus niche products for medical providers and car owners.\\xa0Avant offers personal lines of credit as well as\\xa0unsecured personal loans.Final WordLike ridesharing apps and coworking spaces, Prosper and other P2P lending platforms are all about efficiency.\\xa0Unlike traditional banks, Prosper doesn’t have to maintain physical branches or compensate skilled loan officers for their time. Since it doesn’t use its own money to make loans, it assumes less risk, allowing more borrowers to participate (while clearly conveying the risks to prospective investors). And because it may pool funds from dozens or hundreds of investors to make a single loan, it creates tangible benefits for more participants.While it’s hard to imagine traditional banks disappearing altogether,\\xa0the P2P lending model could influence how they do business – with potential benefits for members of the borrowing public. If ridesharing apps like Uber and Lyft can bring\\xa0the century-old taxi industry to its knees, anything is possible.\\xa0Related21.1K Views23 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInRating: 3.9Updated: November 9, 2017VERDICT Apply NowProsperProsper\\xa0is a great alternative to traditional capital sources. Loans can be much larger than standard-issue credit cards’ spending limits, and substantially cheaper (for borrowers with excellent credit) to boot. For investors, Prosper offers valuable diversification – though it’s not likely to account for more than a small part of a well-balanced portfolio.Prosper is a little one-note – its sole product is an unsecured personal loan. It’s therefore not suitable for business borrowers, nor for individuals seeking specialized financing or refinancing. And its loans aren’t FDIC-insured, so investors without the requisite risk tolerance should steer well clear.Score: 3.9 out of 5 starsKey benefits include low minimum investment requirements, rapid funding for borrowers, relatively high borrowing limits, historically consistent returns, and flexible investment amounts.Notable drawbacks include strict credit requirements for borrowers, geographical restrictions (mostly for investors), higher origination fees, higher default rates than some competing platforms, and limited product selection (just unsecured personal loans).Overall, Prosper is a solid P2P lending platform that’s a suitable niche investment for risk-tolerant individuals seeking diversification and a good source of financing for borrowers seeking alternatives to credit cards.Related ArticlesLending Club Review - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Financial Lending What Are Debt Consolidation Loans - Benefits, Risks & Alternatives SoFi Review - Refinance Your Student Loans Peer-to-Peer How to Get Money to Start a Business - 8 Startup Financing Options 10 Reasons Why You Should NOT Lend Money to Friends & Family What Is the Sharing Economy - Example Companies, Definition, Pros & Cons FacebookTweetPinLinkedInGoogle+StumbleUponPrintEmailCategories: Credit and Debt, Loans, ReviewsBrian MartucciBrian Martucci is a blogger-journalist who writes about frugal living, entrepreneurship, and innovative ideas.

Known by a variety of other names, including “bike taxis” and “cycle rickshaws,” pedicabs are generally three-wheeled vehicles with a forward-positioned driver’s seat and seating space farther back for two to four people.Configurations vary widely, but many pedicabs have semi-weatherproof covers that keep passengers reasonably dry in inclement weather. Some of them sport logos or rudimentary ads for local businesses, an important source of revenue for certain operators.Pedicabs are heavy. The typical vehicle weighs about 300 pounds when empty, and can carry more than 300 pounds of passenger weight, according to The Toledo Blade. To make it easier to start from a dead stop, pedicabs generally have 21 gears or more. Some have electric or gas motors to assist drivers with fully loaded vehicles, though many U.S. jurisdictions ban pedicabs with motors of any kind. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as pedicabs classified as non-motorized vehicles can go many places where cars and motorized scooters can’t, such as park paths and pedestrian malls.However, what about pedicabbers – the people who actually drive these vehicles? What’s it like, and can you make an honest living as a part- or full-time pedicabber – or at least earn enough to make the experience worth your time?How Pedicabbing WorksIn some countries (particularly in the developing world), pedicabs are an important part of the transportation mix, and serve as a viable alternative to public transportation, taxis, and personal vehicles. In North America and Europe, they definitely occupy a smaller niche, catering mostly to tourists and revelers around conventions, concerts, sporting events, and nightlife. However, within this niche, pedicab drivers certainly compete with taxi and ride share operators\\xa0for a share of the transportation market.Pedicab BasicsWith new pedicabs ranging between $3,000 and $4,000, and used vehicles available for less than $2,000, the cost of obtaining one isn’t prohibitive. Some pedicabbers are sole proprietors who own a single pedicab, store it in their home garage, and use it to earn extra cash in their spare time.However, larger outfits- some with dozens of pedicabs in the\\xa0stable – also exist. But unlike big\\xa0taxi companies that serve entire regions, or global ride share apps such as Uber and Lyft, pedicab providers tend to\\xa0stick to a relatively small geographical area – perhaps a few square miles in the center of a city.Like motorized taxis, pedicabs can either be flagged down on the street or reserved ahead of time, usually by phone and less frequently online. Some operators prefer, or stick entirely to, one method over the other.Also like taxis, pedicab operators generally charge fares\\xa0based on a ride’s total length, duration, or both. In cities with regular street grids, per-block charges are common – ranging from less than $1 to $4 or $5, depending on the location. In parks or irregularly laid-out areas, per-minute charges tend to be standard – $2 to more than $5, again depending on location. Some operators also charge by the hour or half-hour – usually $20 to $40 per half-hour, possibly with discounts for longer rides. In all cases, tipping is expected: 15% to 20% of the fare is customary.Types of Pedicab ProvidersPedicab companies are frequently referred to as “shops,” which is also a convenient term for their\\xa0headquarters – typically garages or small warehouses.\\xa0Virtually every U.S. city that allows pedicabs requires shops to carry a business license and commercial liability insurance. Insurance coverage amounts vary, but $1,000,000 per pedicab is a typical figure.Individual pedicab drivers need to be licensed as well. Requirements vary by jurisdiction, but typically include a minimum age threshold\\xa0(16 or 18), valid driver’s license, relatively clean driving record (no DUIs or major accidents within the statute of limitations), and a clean physical bill of health, possibly supported by a doctor’s exam.\\xa0There’s often\\xa0a nominal fee to obtain a pedicab license – $5 to $15 is typical.Pedicab shops\\xa0come in two major\\xa0flavors, depending on their business model and clientele:For-Hire Transportation Providers. This type of provider resembles a traditional taxi company or ride share, providing transportation from point A to point B for a diverse clientele, from tourists and conventioneers to out-on-the-town college students and young professionals. Drivers can be social in the mold of motor cabbies, but aren’t expected to intensively narrate the route – though many do in the hopes of earning a better tip. This type of pedicab operator is more likely to charge by distance, not duration, and to be available for hailing.Route-Based Providers.\\xa0Other pedicab providers bear more resemblance to tour operators. More so than the first type of provider, this group caters explicitly to tourists and those seeking a special experience. As such, they typically cluster in touristy areas, such as New York’s Central Park and Boston‘s historic district, and follow preplanned routes\\xa0designed to hit as many sights as possible. Knowledgeable drivers often highlight historical points of interest and oddities along the way. These folks are more likely to charge by the minute or hour, and to require reservations.The line between these two types can blur.\\xa0For instance, many pedicabbers at taxi-style shops are highly knowledgeable about the areas they work in and thus serve as de facto tour guides for their passengers, particularly those from out of town.Earning Potential and ExpensesLike any\\xa0workers who don’t earn a set salary or flat fee for services rendered, pedicabbers’ earnings vary considerably.\\xa0Your earning potential is largely a function of your shop’s fare schedule, fee arrangement, and situational factors\\xa0particular to your shift.Unlike using your personal vehicle to drive for a ride sharing app, pedicabbing doesn’t have\\xa0steep overhead or maintenance costs, such as auto insurance, gas, and mechanical repairs. However, unless you own your own pedicab, you do face a substantial expense – the fee or cut your shop’s owner takes.These arrangements vary, but commonly include the following:Rental Fees. Some shops rent out pedicabs to licensed drivers, charging a flat fee for the day or a set shift (say, six to eight hours). Under this arrangement, you take home everything you earn after accounting for the fee. For example, if your rental fee is $50 and you take in $200 per shift, you go home with $150.\\xa0To keep their drivers happy and fed, shops sometimes reduce rental fees on slow nights.Fare Cut. Some shops take a cut of a driver’s entire fare haul, excluding tips. This cut varies by shop and location, but can range from 20% to 50%. This arrangement is favorable for slow shifts, when your shop’s cut is relatively small, but can seriously cut into your earnings on busier shifts.Wages and Tips. Some pedicab shops, mostly tour-focused shops whose vehicles are available for hire or stick to preplanned routes, pay their drivers a set hourly wage\\xa0and allow them to keep any tips received at the end of the ride. Under this arrangement,\\xa0drivers receive a paycheck at regular intervals and pass the entirety of any\\xa0fares they collect, less tip, to the shop. Wages are set at prevailing local rates, but drivers can expect to earn at least $10 per hour before tips. This arrangement is somewhat less common than rental fees or fare cuts.Sponsorship. This is an interesting but relatively uncommon arrangement used primarily by operators in jurisdictions with ambiguous pedicab regulations. Operators using the sponsorship model, such as Austin’s Capital Pedicab,\\xa0completely eschew fares. Instead, they\\xa0outfit their pedicabs as moving billboards and charge advertisers – their sponsors – based on the size and number of displays purchased. Drivers work entirely for tips, with\\xa0riders encouraged to pay what they think is fair. The upshot is that there are no rental fees or fare cuts. The downside is little control over earnings and the very real risk of getting stiffed on any given ride.As a pedicabber, various situational factors influence your earnings\\xa0on any given shift, including weather, event schedules, location, day of the week, and competition from other pedicab operators. A\\xa0chilly, rainy Sunday evening when the home team is out of town and no major concerts are scheduled is virtually assured to be less lucrative than a\\xa0balmy Friday night\\xa0that features a concert, a home game, and a Star Trek convention within pedaling distance of one another.All told,\\xa0the wide variety of fare structures, fee arrangements, and situational factors make it\\xa0difficult to generalize about how much you can expect to earn as a pedicab driver. On a slow night, you could earn $70 or $80 in six or eight hours, barely enough to make it worth your time after accounting for your shop’s cut. On a gangbusters night, you could earn $300 or more over the course of six or eight hours, far more than a typical server or taxi driver takes home in a comparable shift.Hours\\xa0and Shift SchedulesMany pedicab shops – particularly those following the for-hire model –\\xa0eschew scheduled, set-length shifts in favor of driver-controlled schedules that follow the laws of supply and demand, at least in theory. During busy periods, such as weekends, evenings, and major events, drivers can count on higher earnings and thus have a greater incentive to work. When demand is lower,\\xa0drivers show up in lower numbers.The big advantage of this laid-back approach to scheduling is that pedicabbers can achieve an excellent work-life balance that allows them to choose how many hours they work in a given week and pursue other interests or goals. For example, I have two good friends who work as pedicabbers in the Bay Area. One is a graduate student who basically works full-time during school breaks and dials back to 10 or 20 hours per week during the semester. The other is an avid outdoorsman who’s known to string together five or six work nights\\xa0in a row, then take off for the mountains for a few days.Though many pedicabbers have tremendous freedom to make their own schedules, it’s important to remember that traditional employment arrangements are rare\\xa0in the industry, mostly confined to shops that basically function as tour operators. Like ride share apps, many pedicab shops treat their “employees” as independent contractors. As a contractor, you’re responsible for keeping track of your own tax liabilities and paying self-employment tax. If you prefer the certainty and simplicity of traditional employment, know that any shop that treats drivers as employees is also likely to schedule them for set shifts.Legal ConsiderationsVirtually every city that permits pedicabs – and many do – has a detailed pedicab ordinance, just as all cities have rules governing taxis.\\xa0Though rules vary widely from place to place, you can expect your city to impose the following regulations:Restrictions on Movement.\\xa0Though pedicabs are usually allowed to share motor vehicle lanes, cities often restrict or forbid movement on major thoroughfares or at busy times. For instance, Savannah, Georgia, prohibits pedicabs from using major streets from 9am to 5pm on weekdays. Savannah also prohibits pedicabs from leaving the city’s central business and tourist district or congregating in groups of four or more.Fare Caps or Regulations.\\xa0Like any industry, the pedicab business has a few bad apples who give their honest colleagues a bad name. In 2012, Fox News reported on a New York pedicabber who charged four unsuspecting tourists more than $440 for a 14-block ride through Manhattan. Though the driver only charged a few bucks per block, the cab’s rate card\\xa0spelled out a huge caveat in tiny print: a $100-per-passenger fee on top of the per-block fee. The tourists complained to the city, which quickly stepped in to regulate pedicabs’ fare structures.\\xa0Most cities now either explicitly regulate pedicab fares – by capping per-block or hourly fees – or require rates to be clearly and prominently spelled out in a visible location within the cab. For instance, New Orleans caps rates at $5 for the first six blocks and $1 per block, per person thereafter, while New York simply requires fares to be clearly displayed in 28-point font or larger.\\xa0If your jurisdiction has strict caps on fares, your take-home earning potential (both as an individual pedicabber or shop owner)\\xa0could\\xa0suffer.Anti-Solicitation Rules.\\xa0Depending on how they’re worded and enforced, anti-solicitation rules can be a major wild card for pedicab operators. For instance, Savannah’s pedicab ordinance states: “It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit passengers verbally or by gesture, directly or indirectly, upon the streets or other areas of the city.” When read literally, that suggests that pedicabbers can’t so much as initiate\\xa0eye contact with prospective fares – they either have to wait for passengers to come to them or do business entirely by dispatch (via called-in, prearranged rides).\\xa0By contrast, I have ample anecdotal evidence that Boston’s pedicabbers operate without fear of an anti-solicitation crackdown. The last time my wife and I were in town, we gamely endured persistent but polite entreaties – some quite enticing\\xa0– from enterprising pedicabbers hanging out\\xa0near Faneuil Hall.Numerical Restrictions.\\xa0Many cities\\xa0cap the number of available pedicab licenses. This is definitely\\xa0a double-edged sword for pedicabbers. On the one hand, numerical restrictions limit competition, theoretically boosting pedicabbers’ earnings. On the other, they make it harder for new entrants\\xa0to break into the business. For entrepreneurial pedicabbers who own – or dream of owning – their own shop, it can also limit growth opportunities.Advantages of Being a Pedicab Driver1. On-the-Job ExerciseAccording to an anecdotal analysis by the Daily Nebraskan, a pedicabber can burn 8,500 calories on a full shift. Contrast that figure with\\xa0the 1,500 to 2,500 calories burned in an entire day by typical humans with more sedentary lifestyles.No bones about it, pedicabbing is great exercise. This is awesome\\xa0for one obvious reason: Overwhelming medical evidence suggests that regular exercise, healthy weight, and cardiovascular fitness all boost mood and reduce risk factors for potentially serious conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. When doing your job is enough to get you in shape, it’s hard not to be healthy.Having an active, healthy occupation is great for a less obvious reason, though: It’s convenient. The exercise you get from three or four pedicabbing shifts per week eliminates the need to exercise when you’re not at work. Cutting out four 30-minute workouts from your weekly routine saves you two hours every seven days – time you can spend attending to other needs or that you can devote to your friends and\\xa0family.2. Outdoor WorkIf you like the sun on your face and the breeze in your hair, pedicabbing could be the job for you. Most pedicabs lack weatherproof compartments for drivers (as opposed to passengers), so you’re likely to be outside for the duration of your shift.There’s something to be said for getting paid to breathe fresh air and bask in the sunshine. Though I’ve never worked as a pedicabber, the outdoor jobs I’ve held have left me more satisfied and happy than I tend to be at the end of a long day in front of my computer.3. Make Your Own ScheduleFor many drivers, pedicabbing is a highly flexible gig. Shops generally eschew\\xa0scheduled, fixed-hour shifts, permitting employees to make their own schedules around other obligations and counting on the allure of higher earnings to ensure adequate coverage during high-demand periods.As a pedicabber, you’re not likely to be at a\\xa0supervisor’s beck and call, nor do you have to structure your life around long-term shift obligations. The result is a favorable work-life balance that allows you to feel like more than the sum of your hours worked.4. Flexible, Often Attractive\\xa0Earning PotentialPedicabbers, even those who earn a set wage plus tips, enjoy flexible earning potential that can often reach impressive heights. During peak periods, it’s common to see passengers\\xa0queue faster than nearby pedicabbers can pick them up, ensuring a steady stream of fares for those on duty. Though demand factors aren’t entirely within pedicabbers’ control, they can also boost their earnings further by chatting up their fares and serving as local ambassadors or tour guides, drawing juicier tips in the process.5. Pedicabbing Is Eco-FriendlyPedicabbing is much better for the environment than driving a taxi or ride share vehicle. According to the New York Taxi & Limousine Commission’s 2014 Taxicab Fact Book, New York City’s taxi vehicles\\xa0get an average of 29 miles to the gallon.\\xa0By contrast, pedicabs plying the streets of Manhattan or Brooklyn – or anywhere else, for that matter – get infinite miles to the gallon, unless you count\\xa0the carbon dioxide their drivers exhale.If you care about your impact on the environment, the eco-friendliness of pedicabs allows you to make money in the transportation business without worrying about your carbon footprint.\\xa0Likewise, the fact that your pedicab\\xa0doesn’t belch carbon into the air likely appeals to sustainability-minded passengers, who tend to select pedal power over gas power, even if the latter gets them to where they’re going a bit quicker. And that’s not just good for the environment – it’s good for your\\xa0bottom line too.6. Great Way to Learn a City’s Geography and HistoryEven if you’ve lived there for years, a pedicabbing gig can be an opportunity to learn more about your city. After all, many pedicab shops function as tour operators, and pedicabbers themselves as tour guides. Even if your shop doesn’t do tours or make education a cornerstone of its business model, you have an economic incentive to learn as much as possible about the areas you work in: Passengers\\xa0tend to tip better after they’ve received a slew of interesting information from a friendly pedicabber about the route they just traversed.The same principle applies to geographical knowledge. Pedicabbing is a great way to learn the shortest distance between point A and point B, including shortcuts that are off-limits to motorized vehicles. This is true even if you use a GPS device to stay on track. And, if you can remember or record your riders’ destinations, pedicabbing is also a great way to discover exciting new businesses or points of interest in your own backyard.7. Great Way to Meet New PeopleDriving a pedicab is a highly social experience – an easy, natural way to meet people. Of course, you’re unlikely to re-encounter most\\xa0of the folks you meet while pedicabbing, especially out-of-town visitors. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t have meaningful, if fleeting, interactions.Pedicabbing also offers an opportunity to form deeper, longer-lasting relationships. This is particularly true for drivers who form long-term associations with specific shops, or who strike out and start their own. For instance, my Bay Area friends don’t simply go to the shop to pick up and drop off their pedicabs. They routinely linger there before and after shifts, shooting the breeze with their compatriots or catching up on schoolwork. They also freely associate with their fellow drivers outside the shop, which isn’t always a given among colleagues.8. No Costs for Operating or Maintaining a Motor VehicleUnlike ride share operators and taxi drivers, pedicabbers don’t have to worry about the costs associated with gas-powered vehicles, such as insurance, maintenance, repairs, parking costs, and fuel.\\xa0Of course, pedicab drivers who own a personal motor vehicle\\xa0must\\xa0deal with some or all of these expenses. However, they’re not required to do so as a condition of their pedicabbing work.Disadvantages of Being a Pedicab Driver1. Potential for Chronic or Serious InjuryDue to the strenuous nature of the work, pedicabbers are at higher risk of injury than those with more sedentary jobs, including taxi and ride share drivers:Overuse Injuries.\\xa0Whenever you use a particular muscle group on a regular basis, particularly if the work is strenuous, you’re at risk for overuse injuries. Pedicabbers contend with the same sorts of injuries as cyclists, mainly ankle, knee, thigh, and groin issues. In extreme cases, these injuries – particularly knee problems – may require surgery to fix properly. More commonly, they simply require temporary reductions in physical activity – though\\xa0being laid up for days or weeks can present serious financial challenges for those who rely on pedicabbing as a primary source of income.Accident-Related Injuries.\\xa0Pedal-powered transportation is dangerous, especially on shared roads. Pedicabbing and cycling aren’t directly analogous, due mainly to the fact that pedicabbers are more visible and tend to stick to areas with slower traffic than\\xa0lone cyclists. However, pedicabbers definitely face a real risk\\xa0from wayward motor vehicles. And, since pedicabs are slow, these accidents are often hit-and-run affairs. According to Fox 7 News, an Austin-area news channel, hit-and-run pedicab accidents are increasingly common in that city’s entertainment district.It’s worth noting that some pedicabbers install low-power electric motors to boost the efficiency of their vehicles and help stave off overuse injuries. However, this is\\xa0often illegal, due to the fact that many jurisdictions classify internally powered vehicles (anything with a motor, electric or otherwise) differently from pedal-powered vehicles.In addition, it can be dangerous: In May 2015, the New York Post reported on a three-alarm fire caused by a pedicab illegally outfitted with a faulty electric motor. Before modifying your pedicab with the aim of making your job easier and safer, check with the local authorities to make sure it’s permitted.2. Prime Shifts Are Often Evenings or WeekendsIn the United States, pedicabs are particularly prevalent in entertainment and sporting districts. These areas tend to be busier in the evenings and on weekends, when most people aren’t at work. Unfortunately, this means that\\xa0evenings and weekends are the best times for pedicabbers to work, at least in terms of earning potential. Though the fact that you can schedule your own pedicabbing hours is a major argument in favor of the occupation,\\xa0it’s partially offset by the fact that the most lucrative shifts occur outside the typical 9-to-5 workday.3. Most Pedicabbers Work as Independent ContractorsSince most pedicab drivers work as independent contractors, they don’t enjoy the protections and perks\\xa0that come with traditional employment arrangements, such as the potential for employer-sponsored insurance and the promise of overtime wages. Pedicabbers who work as independent contractors are also responsible for self-employment tax, which includes a portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes (collectively known as FICA) normally covered by employers on behalf of their\\xa0employees. Self-employment tax represents an additional employment cost not borne\\xa0by traditional employees.4. Highly Volatile EarningsAnother major downside is that there’s no promise of a steady income. Though pedicabbers who work in lively big-city entertainment districts\\xa0can count on picking up at least a few customers on any given night, there are simply too many demand-related factors in play for even the most experienced pedicabbers to arrive at more than a rough ballpark earnings estimate in advance of a\\xa0shift:Weather. No one wants to ride in a pedicab in a cold downpour or snowstorm, even when they’re properly attired or the vehicle is covered. An unexpected weather event can ruin a seemingly promising shift, sending prospective customers running for the comfort of a motor\\xa0taxi or ride share.Performance Schedules. Live music\\xa0venues draw pedicabbers like moths to flames. Many markets have off periods though.\\xa0This creates a feast-or-famine scenario: You might clean up the night U2 comes to town, then suffer for a week as the local music scene goes into hibernation.Conventions. Big conventions attract thousands of attendees looking for a good time – and primed to spend on luxuries like pedicab rides. However, even the\\xa0most popular convention destinations have down periods. This is particularly notable in seasonal destinations. In my hometown of Minneapolis, the convention center is a virtual ghost town in winter. Come summer, I imagine Phoenix’s convention center is pretty dead too.Sporting Events. On game nights, pedicabbers clean up. However, when the home team is out of town, stadium districts empty out. My Bay Area pedicabbing buddies religiously follow the San Francisco Giants’ schedule, working home games whenever possible and taking more time off when the team takes road trips.If you don’t own your own pedicab, it’s also important to consider your arrangement with your shop.\\xa0On slow shifts, a flat rental rate can dramatically cut your take-home earnings. A split-fare arrangement is more attractive\\xa0on slow shifts – but since you’re always required to forward the same percentage to your shop, it can really eat into your earnings on\\xa0busy shifts.5. Potential for Physical DiscomfortPedicabbing is definitely an aerobic workout in sometimes inclement conditions. If you’re looking to get in shape, that’s a good thing, but be aware of the physical costs:Effort and Exertion. Bulging thighs, toned calves, and Olympian levels of stamina don’t come free – especially when you’re pulling\\xa0a 150-pound rickshaw, plus the weight of your passengers. When they’re not waiting around for the next fare, pedicabbers are routinely out of breath. On-the-job cramps are common, and it can take a day or more to nurse\\xa0the aching leg muscles that inevitably result from\\xa0a long shift. After particularly brutal days, one of my Bay Area buddies likes to post\\xa0Facebook pictures of his “recovery routine,” which typically involves lots of sitting, ice packs, and food.Exposure to the Elements.\\xa0Like those who commute by bike, pedicabbers are routinely exposed to the elements. When it’s pleasant outside, this can be a great benefit of the job. When it’s not, it can be the scourge of a pedicabber’s existence. One of my Bay Area friends used to work in Boston, where pedicab-riding locals had\\xa0a far higher tolerance for rain, wind, and cold than his current Californian clientele. Though business definitely dropped off in inclement weather, he’d still occasionally work in conditions that any normal person would consider unpleasant.6. Unpleasant Encounters With Customers and Passers-ByAs service employees, pedicabbers have to deal with the usual\\xa0unpleasant customer archetypes. If you’ve worked in a restaurant or any other service-based profession, you’ve met these people too.\\xa0To make your way in any such job, you need thick skin and a willingness to turn the other cheek.However, pedicabbers must countenance a whole other level of abuse. Unlike restaurant servers, pedicabbers are\\xa0literally on public display as they wait around for customers, then move them from point A to point B. And, since\\xa0pedicabbing is a relatively novel, slow-moving form of transportation that attracts second glances from even the most polite bystanders, there’s plenty of opportunity for less well-intentioned bystanders and customers to heckle and abuse them. Add alcohol to the mix – all too common around concerts, sporting events, and other pedicab-friendly events – and it’s a wonder any pedicabbers are willing to do their jobs at all.Final WordNo one seriously argues that taking a pedicab is the most efficient or cost-effective\\xa0way to get around, at least in the United States. People ride in pedicabs because they’re novel, eco-friendly, more pleasant than taxis, and afford exposure to a city’s sights and sounds.\\xa0For these reasons, pedicab riders are willing to pay a premium for the experience.However, it’s important for pedicab drivers to remember that, for these same reasons, they’re not exactly on par with traditional taxi drivers and ride share operators. In addition, they’re also local ambassadors and tour guides who create lasting memories for many of their riders, even when “tour guide” isn’t in the official job description.If the idea of being the face of your city appeals to you, pedicabbing could be a great side gig or primary job. If you prefer a less social line of work, look elsewhere.Do you know anyone who drives a pedicab?Related30 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInRelated ArticlesThe Future of Automobiles & Car Technology - Hybrid, Electric & Driverless Cars RV Living: How to Choose a Camper & Where to Camp Understanding the CAFE Fuel Efficiency Standards for New Cars 11 Factors That Affect Car Insurance Rates - How to Lower Your Costs Keep Driving an Old Car or Buy New - What's Better?
